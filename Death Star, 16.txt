EXECUTIVE LEVEL, DEATH STAR
 
 Daala stepped from the shower, a 
waft of hot water vapor following her 
out. Tarkin smiled as she dried herself 
with a fluffy black towel made of 
virgin cotton from the Suliana fields 
and slipped into a matching robe. She 
stood under the air jets and dried her 
short hair, then came into the 
bedchamber and sat on the foot of the 
bed.
 "Feel better?" Tarkin asked.
 "Much. So much nicer to have hot 
water than the sonics."
 "Yes. Rank has its privileges. You 
have news for me?"
 "I do. You won't like it."
 He sat up and looked at her.
 She went to the desk, opened a 
drawer, and removed an info disk. 
She dialed his computer terminal to 
life.
 "You have my access codes?" Now 
he slid out of the bed, the silk of his 
sleepwear causing static electricity as 
it moved across the sheets. His gown 
crackled and clung to his body, but he 
ignored it as he walked to where she 
stood.
 She smiled at him. "Of course."
 "Did I give them to you?"
 "You don't remember? Well, if you 
didn't, I know you meant to."
 Tarkin wasn't sure if he should be 
angered or aroused by this evidence 
of Daala's boldness. Before he could 
decide, a hologram blinked on. It 
showed rows of sealed cargo 
containers, the white everplast boxes 
stacked three-deep, with corridors 
between them to allow access. They 
looked like standard two-point-five-
meter units, but it was hard to say just 
by looking.
 "Security cam," she said. "Aft cargo 
hold on the Undauntable."
 "A security cam that was not 
destroyed in the explosion?"
 "Oh, it was blown up with the rest of 
the ship. But it was rigged to feed a 
signal to a receiver. I obtained the 
recording."
 "How?"
 "A moment. Watch."
 There was a date/time stamp in the 
lower right-hand corner of the image, 
the seconds flashing by . . . 
 A figure moved into view. Tarkin 
frowned. It was still hard to judge size 
without some kind of scale.
 As if reading his thoughts, Daala 
moved her hand over a sensor, and a 
grid overlaid the image. The figure 
was slightly less than two meters tall. 
That still didn't tell him much. With 
the cloak and hood concealing it, it 
could have been any of a hundred 
species.
 The mysterious being walked along 
the row of containers. It reached one 
in the middle of the cam's field and 
tapped the keypad on the door with 
one gloved finger.
 "Why didn't we have bioscanners 
going as well?" Tarkin asked, 
annoyed. "We'd have data on species, 
sex, age?"
 "Shh," she said. "We were lucky to 
have gotten this much. Now watch."
 The door rolled up and the figure 
entered the container.
 Thirty seconds passed. The figure 
emerged, closed the door behind 
him?or her?and moved out of cam 
view.
 Daala waved the recording off. She 
looked at him, waiting.
 Tarkin was nobody's fool. "The 
explosive device was in the cargo 
container and ready to go. All the 
agent had to do was trigger it."
 "Yes. He didn't bring anything with 
him, so it had to be in place already."
 "And?"
 She turned to the console's controls. 
Another image appeared, this one a 
routing manifest.
 "The rigged container's ID number is 
not visible in the recording, but the 
number of the one eight down is, so it 
was a simple matter to figure out the 
one we want."
 True, Tarkin thought. Loading 
droids were not known for creativity. 
They stacked cargo containers by the 
numbers.
 "You can see that this container 
came from the cargo vessel Omega 
Gaila, itself from the ammunition 
stores at the Regional Naval Supply 
Area near Gall. The container carried 
high explosives, so that's what a scan 
would show?if anybody bothered to 
do one."
 She waited again.
 Tarkin thought about it. "The RNSA 
at Gall is a high-security facility. 
Extremely tight. Nobody on or off the 
base without top clearance, even the 
cargo handlers."
 "Yes."
 He frowned. Shook his head. "Not 
possible."
 "Yet somebody got into a container 
and rigged it with a bomb powerful 
enough to blast a Star Destroyer apart. 
And they weren't shooting in the dark, 
hoping to hit something, because it 
took somebody on the other end to 
arm the device."
 "So they knew where it was bound," 
he finished for her. "No way to have 
agents at every possible destination. 
Once it got to our storage facility, it 
could have gone to any of several 
ships."
 "Or to this station," she said. "It was 
the luck of the draw that Undauntable 
needed ammo before we did."
 "So it's being run by somebody 
higher than a cargo handler. At the 
very least, there had to be somebody 
from Routing involved, and enough of 
a conspiracy to be able to place or 
contact an agent already here. We are 
talking about a Rebel spy in the 
Imperial Navy with more than a little 
reach."
 "Just so."
 "We can probably determine who 
loaded the container, and who routed 
it."
 "Which is good, but also doesn't stop 
something similar from happening 
again if the next shipment comes from 
a different source."
 "Correct. We need to find whoever 
is running the agents here," he said.
 "I concur."
 He looked at her. "How do you plan 
to do this?"
 "I'm assuming that the agent did not 
choose suicide. We have the day and 
time the device was activated. He or 
she would have had to arrive before 
that time, and depart before the 
explosion. Undauntable's operational 
logs were backed up on the station's 
computer, the last entry coming just 
before the ship's destruction. It might 
take some time, but we can access 
those and narrow down the 
possibilities."
 "Good," Tarkin said. "Do so 
immediately."
 She smiled and adjusted the lapels of 
her robe. "Immediately?"
 He did not return her smile. "Yes. 
There are times for dalliance, and 
times for action. I want a report by 
zero five hundred hours."
 Daala nodded and began to dress, 
quickly.

MEDCENTER, SECTION N-ONE, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Uli looked at his commander 
incredulously. Since Hotise had 
arrived and set up shop on the station, 
they hadn't seen each other that much, 
and Uli wasn't happy to be seeing him 
now.
 "What?" Hotise said. "You seem to 
think that I personally run this war, 
Doctor. Believe me, if I did, it'd be 
run a sight better. As it is, there are 
things that are simply in short supply. 
Medical doctors, not to mention 
psychiatrists, are hard to come by, 
even here with the big green light. It 
won't kill you to step into the breach 
now and then. You did rotations in 
both disciplines during your 
residency."
 "Of course I did. I'm not 
complaining about the work. But I'm a 
surgeon, not an internal meds doctor. 
My skills are rusty outside my 
specialty."
 "Well, you have state-of-the-art 
robotics backing you up, as well as 
the top-of-the-line diagnosters in the 
galaxy. A first-year medical student 
or a competent droid could run those 
and hit the mark ninety-five percent 
of the time."
 "You're making my point for me, 
Doctor." Uli held his hands up. 
"These are for cutting, not tapping 
knees and treating headaches. It's not 
the best use of my talents."
 Hotise shrugged. "Making best use 
of talent has never been the military's 
mission, son. They change about as 
fast as a space slug molts. If they want 
to have a doctor digging trenches in 
the field of battle, they will have him 
do just that?because they can.
 "If routine physicals get in the way 
of your surgery, then let them slide. 
But as long as you aren't slicing and 
gluing, we don't have enough help for 
you to sit around waiting for another 
body to open up." He leaned forward, 
putting his hands on Uli's cluttered 
desk. He looked, Uli thought, about 
twenty years older than he had 
months before, when he'd assigned 
Uli his duties. Uli could also smell a 
faint whiff of alcohol on his breath.
 "Eventually," Hotise continued, 
"we'll be fully staffed, but until then, 
we have to spread ourselves around."
 "And if the spread is too thin for the 
good of the patients?"
 Hotise straightened. "Suck it up, Dr. 
Divini. There is a war on, after all."
 Uli sighed and nodded. He hadn't 
really expected anything else. And 
tired or not, drunk or not, the man was 
right. A surgeon lying on a couch 
could just as easily be treating routine 
lumps and bumps.
 Didn't mean he had to like it, though.
 "You have patients to see," Hotise 
said. "So I'll get out of your hair. 
Have a nice shift."
 The older man exited the office, and 
Uli glared at Hotise's back as he left.
 "I'm unfamiliar with all the nuances 
of human behavior," C-4ME-0 said, 
"but I think it's safe to say that you 
didn't come out the best in that 
exchange."
 "You're the second wise-mouth 
droid I've met. If I never meet another 
one, my life would not suffer a bit."
 "Here's the next patient's chart, 
Doctor."
 "Go find something useful to do 
before I decide you need to be 
reprogrammed as a latrine cleaner. 
We can do that in the military, you 
know. Take a medical droid and put 
him to that use."
 "Idle threats do not become you, Dr. 
Divini."
 Uli smiled despite himself and 
looked at the chart. It described the 
complaint of one Sergeant Nova Stihl, 
a guard, who was having . . . 
 Bad dreams?
 Great. Wonderful. He knew less 
about psychological maladies than he 
did Rodian influenza.
 In the exam room, the patient sat on 
the table wearing a disposable flimsi 
gown. Offhand, he looked fit and 
muscular; on the face of it he didn't 
appear to be beset with any major 
psychosis. His affect was calm.
 "Sergeant Stihl. I'm Dr. Divini. What 
seems to be the problem?"
 The man gave him a little shrug and 
looked embarrassed. "Trouble 
sleeping."
 "I see. Says here you've been having 
nightmares?"
 "Yeah. I hate to waste your time on 
piddly stuff, Doc, but I'm starting to 
doze off at work. Maybe you can give 
me a pill or something?"
 "No problem there, we have all 
kinds of sleeping meds. But we 
should probably try to figure out the 
cause before we try curing it."
 Stihl shrugged again. "You're the 
doctor."
 "How long has it been going on?"
 "Hard to say. I used to have a bad 
night once in a while at my last 
posting, but they've gotten worse 
since I was transferred up here. More 
frequent."
 "Uh-huh. Any stress at your job?"
 Stihl laughed. "I'm a guard. I deal 
with sodders locked in detention who 
don't want to be there, most of whom 
did something illegal to get there. 
Stress goes with the territory."
 "Been doing it awhile?"
 "Since I joined up. Eleven standard 
years."
 "Okay. So the stress level now is 
what? More, less, the same?"
 "A little less, actually. I was posted 
dirtside before. Some real touchy 
types on Despayre, most of 'em 
crazier than a rabid Shistavanen. Guys 
detained here on the station are 
generally military or civilian 
contractors who got too frisky or 
greedy. Not many career criminals. 
Easier to deal with, 'cause they got 
more to lose."
 "Okay. Recreation?"
 "I do martial arts."
 "Getting hit in the head more than 
usual?"
 Stihl laughed. "Other way around. 
I'm the teacher?I don't get tagged, 
much."
 "Anything new or different so far as 
diet? Alcohol? Quarters? 
Relationships?"
 "Not that you'd notice. I get along 
with my unit, eat the same stuff I 
usually eat, don't spend my time 
drinking. Basic barracks are the same 
all over the galaxy; I share a cube 
with a few other NCOs; they aren't 
any trouble. I tend to serial 
monogamy and don't have anybody 
I'm seeing right now."
 Subjective analysis seemed normal. 
"Could be an allergy. Lot of 
construction chaff and microscopic 
dust floating around before the filters 
catch it. Let's do a physical, make sure 
all your systems are online, run some 
analyses of blood and urine and stuff 
like that, do a mag-scan. If we find 
something we can fix, we'll fix it. If 
everything checks out, I've got meds 
that will knock you out like you were 
hit with a mallet, and guarantee a 
dreamless sleep for six hours."
 "Sounds good."
 Uli did a physical exam, which was 
unremarkable. The man was as fit as 
he had first thought, at least to the 
trained eye. He had C-4ME-0 take the 
patient to the diagnoster array and run 
the standard battery of tests, covering 
all the major systems. The machines 
were fast; the first results started 
coming in before the second batch of 
tests began.
 Things looked unremarkable. Stihl 
was in great shape for a man his age, 
better than most humans twenty years 
younger. Myoconduction, brain scan, 
EEG, MEG, dendrite function were 
within limits. Afferent/ efferent 
speeds were slightly better than 
normal; heart, lungs, kidneys, liver, 
spleen, pancreas, repro, bowels . . . 
 Uli looked at the blood composition 
readout. Platelets fine, WBC normal 
spread, hematocrit, hemoglobin, all 
normal.
 Except?
 His midi-chlorian count was over 
five thousand per cell.
 Uli blinked. That was unusual. 
Normal human range was less than 
half that. He didn't know a lot about 
midi-chlorians; nobody did 
anymore?most of the research on the 
subject had been done at the Jedi 
academy by their own healers, and 
their records were not available for 
study. A shame. The Jedi were all 
gone . . . 
 Like Barriss . . . 
 He shook his head. He didn't want to 
rocket down that particular space 
lane, thank you. When he'd met 
Barriss, he'd been up for his first tour 
in the field, young and idealistic. Now 
Barriss was gone?and so was his 
idealism.
 This blasted war . . . 
 He pulled himself back to the task at 
hand. Could the high midi-chlorian 
count be somehow responsible for the 
sergeant's dreams? If the Jedi were 
correct, these were the vital living 
components that connected everything 
to the Force. And he'd heard that the 
Force could sometimes cause strange, 
even prescient dreams. It seemed to 
make sense, especially given that it 
was the only anomaly on the tests.
 "So what's the drill, Doc?"
 Uli explained the stats to him. The 
sergeant looked blank. "Mini whats?"
 "Midi. Chlorians."
 "And you think that might be the 
problem?"
 "Frankly, I don't know. Not my 
specialty. I'll check into it and get 
back to you, but in any case it 
shouldn't be dangerous at your levels. 
You aren't going to die from it."
 Stihl looked relieved. "That's 
something, anyhow."
 "I'll give you some tablets that 
should allow you to rest."
 "Thanks, Doc. I appreciate it."
 "Just doing my job," Uli said.
 After the sergeant was gone, Uli 
accessed the station's medical library. 
Not surprisingly, there was no more to 
be had on midi-chlorians than he 
already knew.
 Maybe there was a doctor with 
specialized knowledge of cell biology 
on the station, or assigned to one of 
the warships in the area. He started to 
post a query on the MedNet, but then 
stopped. Was this a good idea? he 
asked himself. The Emperor had 
ordered a complete ban on any and all 
data having to do with Jedi and the 
Force. So thorough had been the 
revisionism that now, barely two 
decades after the Jedi heroism of the 
Clone Wars, nearly every reference in 
every data bank in the galaxy had 
been purged of matters and 
information relating to the order. 
Most beings born since then knew 
little, if anything, about those larger-
than-life characters whose names had 
once been on everyone's lips, and 
their elders were smart enough not to 
talk about the subject. The ban, as far 
as Uli knew, was still in effect. Did he 
really want to put up a query on a 
public forum concerning such a 
highly sensitive topic? After all, 
Sergeant Stihl seemed to be in no 
danger, immediate or long-term. He'd 
never heard of midi-chlorians being 
associated with any pathology. Did 
his oath to heal extend so far as to put 
himself in harm's way by asking for 
information on a forbidden topic, 
especially when the patient seemed to 
be in no danger?
 Yes, he reluctantly decided. If there 
was the slightest chance that the midi-
chlorians were causing, or had the 
potential to cause, ill health for Nova 
Stihl, It was Uli's duty as a healer to 
pursue all courses of inquiry.
 C-4ME-0 entered. "Your next 
patient is ready, Doctor." As he 
interviewed the next patient, Uli 
realized that, while he'd resented 
Hotise's laying additional work on 
him initially, now he was glad of it. It 
took his mind off what a moral 
quagmire the galaxy had become.

ISD DEVASTATOR, ARKONIS SECTOR, 
OUTER RIM
 
 Lord Vader?" "What is it, 
Lieutenant?"
 The lieutenant practically stank of 
fear. Normally that was to be 
expected and not a problem, for fear 
was a useful tool. But occasionally it 
could be time consuming.
 "You aren't afraid," Vader said, 
drawing his fingers together to 
concentrate the Force.
 "I'm not afraid," the lieutenant 
echoed. The tightness in his face and 
body relaxed, somewhat.
 "You have something for me?"
 "Yes, sir." The lieutenant held up a 
printout flimsi sheet. "One of your 
warning flags has been tripped. A 
surgeon on board the battle station has 
requested from the local MedNet 
information on midi-chlorians."
 "Very well. Leave it here. You may 
go."
 "Sir." The man left. Weak-minded 
idiot he still was, but at least he wasn't 
shaking in his boots.
 Vader read the new dispatch with 
interest. He considered the knowledge 
therein. Why would someone on the 
battle station be looking for 
information on midi-chlorians?
 Vader knew all about midi-
Chlorians, of course?he personally 
had the highest count per cell ever 
recorded, more than twenty thousand. 
More than Yoda, and, he knew, more 
than his erstwhile Master, Kenobi. 
Which meant that, potentially, he 
could have a stronger connection to 
the Force than anyone. Since most, if 
not all, of the Jedi were no more, that 
was all the sweeter, though Vader was 
convinced that Obi-Wan had 
remained hidden all these years, as 
had Yoda, assuming the latter had not 
finally shuffled off into death. Yoda 
had been very old, after all, and the 
defeat and deaths of the Jedi could not 
have helped him age any easier. He 
could be dead. But it was unwise to 
make such assumptions about such a 
powerful Jedi Master.
 Back to the subject at hand. It might 
be wise to have a word with this 
medic and see what he was up to. 
Midi-chlorians did not normally 
figure into the medical treatment of 
most beings. This was unusual.
 Not unusual enough to leave his 
current mission and go investigate, 
however. Soon enough he would have 
reason to return to the battle station. 
He would deal with this doctor and 
his strange request when he went.
 For now, it was time to go again to 
his hyperbaric chamber, to rest and 
recharge. There was much that needed 
to be done in the service of his 
Master, and never enough time to do 
it all.



ARCHITECTURAL OFFICES, EXECUTIVE 
LEVEL, DEATH STAR
 
 Teela saw the flowers on her desk 
when she arrived for her shift, a spray 
of everlilies, rojos, blueblossoms, and 
purple passions, artfully arranged by 
somebody who knew how to mix and 
match them for the most visual 
appeal. She could smell the spicy, 
peppery scent of the rojos wafting in 
the office air currents as she drew 
nearer.
 The card with the arrangement said, 
SO WHERE DO WE GO FROM HERE?
 That, she thought, is a good 
question.
 There wasn't any real future for 
them. He was an Imperial TIE fighter 
pilot on war duty, and she was a 
convicted criminal working as a 
trustee on the biggest battle station 
ever designed and built. Their 
backgrounds were too different, their 
loyalties too far apart. While it was 
true that they would both go where 
the Empire told them to go, and do 
what they were ordered to do, Teela 
did so because there was no real 
choice, whereas Vil gloried in his 
work.
 Construction on the station kept 
getting faster as the crews learned 
from the first sections built and were 
able to build new ones with less 
wasted effort. Some parts of the 
process had been so streamlined that 
the work went nearly twice as fast as 
it had before. The army of 
construction droids worked tirelessly, 
day in and day out; an interior 
structure that would ordinarily take 
months to finish with organic labor 
would often be completed in only a 
few days. It was amazing and, to an 
architect, most gratifying to see such 
constructions appear as if by magic. 
The only ones who came close to 
matching the droids' speed were the 
Wookiees. Teela remembered an old 
saying: Give a Wookiee a knife and 
send him into a forest in the morning, 
and by evening he would have carved 
you a table to eat dinner on?and a 
house to put it in.
 They were on schedule in many 
areas, ahead in many more, and 
behind in only a few. Teela felt mixed 
emotions at this. After the station was 
completed, it would go off to engage 
the Rebels and help destroy the 
insurrection, and Vil would be in the 
thick of all that. And where would she 
be? Probably back on the prison 
planet for the rest of her life.
 Then again, life was always 
uncertain. You could get hit by a 
hovertruck crossing a street. There 
were myriad diseases that would kill 
you in short order. Somebody could 
forget to weld a seal and a 
decompressive blowout could spit you 
into cold vacuum, where you'd be 
dead and frozen solid before anybody 
came to collect you, if they even 
bothered. You didn't get up every 
morning expecting such things to 
happen?that way lay depression as 
deep as space itself?but you had to 
know that life was short and there 
were no guarantees.
 So at the moment she had a spray of 
beautiful flowers on her desk that 
probably cost a couple of days' pay, 
and the attention of a not-unattractive 
man who wanted to spend his time 
and energy with her. Today, 
tomorrow, a month, a year . . .  
nobody knew how long they had, so 
why not seize the moment and enjoy 
it as much as possible?
 Her inner self allowed as how that 
made sense. Go for it, girl.
 She moved her hand over her desk's 
console and lit the comm. After a 
moment, the holo came up. Vil smiled 
at her.
 "Hey," he said.
 "Hey, yourself. The flowers are 
lovely. Thank you."
 "We still on for dinner tonight?" he 
asked.
 "Yes. But I'm betting I can do a 
better fogu than any restaurant on 
board. Why don't you come to my 
cube and let me cook for you?"


PART TWO
Shakedown

CORRIDORS ADJACENT TO DETENTION 
BLOCK AA, LEVEL FIVE, DEATH STAR
 
 Sergeant Stihl, we have intruders! 
There's a breakout on Level Five, 
Detention Block AA-Twenty-three. 
Take a squad and get over there!"
 Nova stared at the lieutenant in 
disbelief. Intruders? A breakout? How 
was that possible?
 "Sergeant!"
 No time to wonder about it now. 
"Copy, sir, on our way! Bretton, Zack, 
Dash, Alix, Kai, with me! Mahl, Cy, 
Dex, Nate, on point! Move out, 
people!"
 The squad hustled out of the 
barracks and into the hall, the sound 
of their armor rattling as they moved. 
The corridors were strangely deserted, 
which Nova chalked up to luck. 
Fewer people meant fewer civilian 
casualties.
 "Who are we after, Sarge?" That 
from Dash.
 Nova didn't know. Who were they 
after?
 Well, kark it, he'd know them if he 
saw them.
 "Just shoot who I tell you to," he told 
the trooper. Then he raised his voice 
to include the rest of the squad: 
"Double-time it, people!"
 They ran through the gray-and-black 
halls, following the four guards on 
point, their sidearms held up, fingers 
outside the trigger guards, as per 
regulations. The ceilings and floors 
were covered with blaster-proof 
absorbital, so if somebody 
accidentally cooked off a round it 
wouldn't do any damage. If you 
carried your weapon pointed at the 
floor, however, there was a good 
chance in a crowd that you'd shoot 
somebody's foot off, and the walls 
and vent grates weren't all that sturdy, 
either.
 The corridor branched ahead. As 
they approached, Nova was 
desperately trying to remember which 
one led to D-Unit when a blaster bolt 
sizzled through a cross corridor 
ahead. The four guards on point 
skidded to a stop, then moved ahead 
slowly toward the intersection to peer 
around it.
 Nova suddenly realized this was all 
familiar. It was as if he had been here 
before, seen the events that were now 
unfolding. He knew, without knowing 
how, that in the next few seconds a 
squad of stormtroopers was going 
to?
 "Aaahhhh!" Somebody beyond the 
bend in the corridor screamed, and a 
moment later half a dozen troopers 
barreled around the corner of the 
hallway intersection, heading toward 
Nova and his men.
 They were being chased by a single 
man with a blaster, yelling like a 
berserker as he ran. The man?Nova 
saw that he was dressed like a down-
on-his-luck spacer?stopped, 
realizing that there were suddenly 
overwhelming odds in front of him. 
Then he turned and ran back the other 
way, putting on a burst of speed as he 
disappeared around the corner.
 "After him! Go!" Nova led the 
pursuit, followed by his squad and the 
others. Once around the bend, he saw 
that the fleeing spacer had been joined 
by a Wookiee, and both of them were 
now shooting back at their pursuers as 
they fled. A blaster bolt took the man 
next to Nova. He tried to line up on 
the runners, but was jostled by 
somebody from behind; his bolt 
scorched the plating just behind the 
two escapees. The human zapped 
another round at them.
 Time slowed down. The bolt 
crawled toward them, impossibly 
slow. But as slowly as it was moving, 
Nova found he was moving even 
slower . . .  the deadly energy burst 
was going to hit him, and there was 
nothing he could do to stop it.
 The blaster bolt slammed into him, 
penetrating the chest plate easily. It 
pierced his chest, burned out his heart, 
and he fell, dying?
 Nova jerked up in bed, his pulse 
racing, as one of his cubemates 
hollered, "Hey, Stihl! Wake the frip 
up, you're yelling in your sleep again! 
Some of us are trying to get some
