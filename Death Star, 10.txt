 Ratua didn't have any connection to 
religion?he didn't subscribe to any of 
the doctrines or dogmas, more than a 
few of which he had been exposed to 
in his life. However, if there was one 
that promised a thieves' paradise, it 
might not be too different from this 
battle station.
 He'd been afraid at first that he'd 
have to skulk about the outlying 
corridors and hallways, staying in the 
shadows, taking service tubes and 
stairs to avoid being stopped by 
station security. But he had walked 
past guards scores of times, hesitantly 
at first, then with less worry, and 
finally with nothing but confidence. 
As far as he could tell, nobody had 
even lifted an eyebrow in his 
direction. Nobody stopped him and 
asked him what business he was on; 
nobody asked for identification, as 
long as he stayed away from corridors 
and chambers plainly marked off-
limits to unauthorized personnel; in 
short, nobody seemed to notice him at 
all. The prevailing attitude seemed to 
be that if you were on the station, then 
you must belong here, and as long as 
you weren't doing something that 
looked suspicious, you were free to 
come and go as you liked.
 Ratua wasn't quite to the point where 
he swaggered about as if he owned 
the place, but he did move now with a 
certain confidence that belied his true 
status, and which, no doubt, made him 
even more invisible to the cools. He 
strolled into the public cafeterias, 
selected food and drink, and ate 
unmolested. No ID was necessary for 
that; food was free.' He'd even slipped 
into a supply depot and, using his 
speedy mode, had "borrowed" fresh 
clothes?a basic freight handler's 
coveralls.
 The first few days he had been on 
the station, he'd found a few empty 
trash chutes that didn't seem to be 
used, where a clever being could rig a 
couple of crosspiece supports and 
camp out of sight. Of course, you had 
to be careful that somebody didn't 
open the chute and dump trash onto 
your impromptu bivouac, but that had 
only happened once. Still, it had been 
sufficiently discomfiting to send him 
looking for more congenial hiding 
places?that, and the suspicion 
gleaned from sounds and smells that 
there were things living on the 
garbage levels. Big things.
 After that, he found all manner of 
storage spaces that were empty or 
nearly so, and for a being with his 
skills, slipping into these when 
nobody was around was child's play. 
He could sleep there without much 
worry at all.
 Food, shelter, clothes?he had all the 
basics. And after he had gotten the lay 
of the place, some artful scavenging 
had provided basic items for barter.
 "Ho, trooper. You know anybody 
who might have use for a D-nine 
battery pack in pretty good condition? 
As it happens, I have one and find 
myself a little short of coin until 
payday. Worth ten c's, easy, but I can 
let you have it for seven . . . "
 Within a week he had a pretty good 
stash of trade goods hidden in a 
recycling station storage bin, enough 
credits to buy small items he couldn't 
get for free or "borrow," and a line to 
a couple of quartermasters who were 
making a little extra in the gray and 
black markets.
 No matter where you went, people 
were the same. There were honest 
ones, dishonest ones, generous, 
greedy, all across the spectrum, and if 
you were paying attention you could 
tell which were which and use them to 
your benefit. If he had learned nothing 
else living on a prison planet, he had 
learned to pay attention.
 By creating a false identi-tab he 
became Teh Roxxor, an inspector 
employed by a civilian contractor who 
built storage bins for recycling 
stations, which gave him a reason to 
be in such places. Not that it seemed 
necessary; the one time a guard had 
seen him going boldly into one of his 
storage spaces, Ratua had just smiled 
and nodded at him, and the guy had 
waved back and gone on about his 
business.
 Unbelievable. Give him a year like 
this, he'd be running this battle station 
. . .

REC ROOM 17-A, LEVEL 36, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Lieutenant Vil Dance looked around 
the interior of the rec room. It was of 
basic design?tall ceiling, mirrors 
along one wall, an expanse of padded 
floor?and otherwise empty save for 
seven or eight people, all of them 
humans but one, a tall Rodian with a 
vibroblade scar across his face. Didn't 
see a lot of them in the military?
didn't see many aliens at all, given 
how generally xenophobic the Empire 
was?but Vil had heard that some of 
them were pretty good bounty 
hunters. Given that, he could 
understand why the Rodian might be 
here. It helped explain the face scar as 
well.
 Vil checked his chrono. Class was 
supposed to start in five minutes.
 Most of the others looked to be in 
pretty good shape, which wasn't 
unexpected. Not a lot of do-little types 
would bother to stir their backsides to 
come and try something that required 
any physical effort. He knew plenty of 
pilots who, outside of the required 
calisthenics, got most of their exercise 
from walking to the cooler to get 
another bottle of ale. Vil kept in pretty 
fair shape on his own; he wasn't here 
so much for the workout, or even the 
knowledge, as he was for the 
possibility that he might gain a tiny 
edge as a pilot. At the Academy, 
somebody had done some research 
and found that people who studied 
this kind of thing had slightly better 
scores in the flight simulators due to 
decreased reaction time. He'd never 
really had a chance to try it before. He 
was, he knew, already an excellent 
pilot, but every little bit he could add 
to that was worth checking into.
 The door slid open. A man in gray 
workout skins walked into the room. 
He had a rolling, muscular gait and a 
big smile, and appeared to be in his 
early thirties. He wasn't particularly 
big or impressively muscled, but 
something about the way he moved, 
the economy of his motion, said to Vil 
that this guy knew his stuff.
 "I'm Sergeant Nova Stihl," he said, 
"and I'd guess that almost everybody 
here outranks me. But let's get this 
straight from the start?I don't care if 
you're a gasser or an admiral, this is 
my class. What we are talking about is 
teras kasi, a martial art designed for 
close work. Hands, feet, elbows, 
knives, sticks. I expect I know more 
about this stuff than any of you, so 
what I say goes. You can't live with 
that, walk now. Unless, of course, 
somebody can demonstrate they are 
better than I am, in which case, I'll 
take lessons from you." He paused. 
"So do we have any fighters here?"
 Vil felt he could handle himself 
reasonably well when the furniture 
started flying, but there was no way 
he was going to step up to that kind of 
comment. It wasn't the sort of 
invitation anyone in his right mind 
would extend unless he was 
reasonably confident of what the end 
result would be.
 He looked around. A couple of the 
men looked to be ground-pounders, 
thick with enough muscle to be 
dangerous. There was one guy, a little 
smaller than most, who had a feral 
gleam in his eyes. Vil's impression 
was that he wouldn't want to have the 
guy behind him in a dark corridor. 
And there was the Rodian, but he 
didn't know enough about Rodians to 
judge that one.
 One of the men he'd pegged as 
ground-pounders said, "I c'n handle 
m'self okay."
 Stihl gave him a welcoming grin. 
The ground-pounder was taller, 
heavier, and he did look like a man 
you wouldn't want mad at you. Vil 
had the feeling, however, that that 
wasn't going to make a whole lot of 
difference to Sergeant Stihl.
 "Okay," the instructor said. "Come 
and show me something. Knock me 
down and I'll buy your drinks for the 
next month."
 The ground-pounder grinned at that. 
"Comin' right up, Sarge!"
 Vil thought, Tbis'll be interest?and 
before his mind could finish the 
thought, it was over. The big ground-
pounder stepped in, swung a punch 
that would have dented quadanium 
plate, and a second later was lying flat 
on his face.
 Vil didn't have a clue what the 
sergeant had done to cause it. He'd 
just made some kind of fast sidestep 
and what looked like a wave of his 
hands, and bam! the attacker hit the 
floor hard enough that Vil could feel 
it vibrate.
 Ouch . . . 
 There was a surprised murmur from 
the others that indicated they didn't 
know what Stihl had done, either. Bet 
the next class is a lot bigger once this 
gets around, Vil thought.
 "Anybody else want to give it a 
shot?"
 Much shuffling of feet, inspection of 
fingernails, and sudden interest in the 
ceiling. Nobody did, apparently.
 "Good." Stihl reached one hand 
down and helped the ground-pounder 
to his feet. "Then let's get started."



MEDCENTER, DEATH STAR
 
 Because there weren't enough 
medical doctors or droids to go 
around, Uli found himself, somewhat 
to his annoyance, doing routine 
physical exams on new arrivals to the 
station. Using a surgeon for such 
work was rather like using a protocol 
droid to run a water converter?the 
task would be accomplished, speedily 
and efficiently, but it would definitely 
not be the most effective use of the 
droid's time and skill.
 He gave the diagnoster printout of 
the just-finished scan a look-over 
while his latest patient got dressed. 
The man was human, originally from 
Corellia, but he'd been eking out a 
grim existence on Despayre for the 
last four months. Nowhere on his 
dossier did it list the reason he'd been 
banished to that pesthole. Why should 
it? No point in wasting pixels on a 
man who, for all intents and purposes, 
was dead.
 The stats were unsurprising: elevated 
urinary nitrogen, compromised 
immune system, vitamin and mineral 
deficiencies, incipient scurvy . . .  
borderline malnutrition, in short. The 
man was lean as a Givin, with no 
excess fat at all to soften sinew and 
musculature. He'd been able to 
survive, but, if he hadn't been scooped 
up in one of the regular sweeps for 
more workers, he wouldn't have lasted 
much longer. Now his problems were 
over, for the short run at least. No 
more subsisting on boiled knob-
blypears and roasted ratbats; the 
mass-produced rations that were the 
workers' diet might not be particularly 
tasty, but they would be nutritious 
enough to keep him alive and laboring 
for the Empire.
 Until he was, most likely, worked to 
death.
 After the Corellian had been led out 
by a med droid, Uli rubbed his eyes 
and asked, "Who's up next?"
 C-4ME-0 said, "Memah Roothes, 
female, Rutian Twi'lek, Ryloth, 
arrived onstation nine days past from 
Imperial Center."
 "Coruscant," Uli corrected the droid. 
"I always hated that name change." 
He glanced at the wall chrono. Nearly 
eleven forty-five hours; he'd been on 
his feet since twenty-three hundred.
 "Memah Roothes is a civilian 
contractor whose designation is RSW-
Six, subgrade two, Miscellaneous 
Entertainment and Services."
 "Which means what?"
 "She was hired to run a cantina in 
this sector."
 Uli couldn't help but feel slightly 
peeved at the droid. "Why didn't you 
just say that in the first place?"
 "I did, Captain Dr. Divini. If you had 
studied your Imperial Designation 
Manual, you could hardly have 
reached any other conclusion."
 "I don't need a droid telling me to 
read the manual, thank you very 
much."
 C-4ME-0 made a snorting sound.
 "What was that?"
 "Condensation on my vocabulator. It 
needed to be cleared."
 Uli grinned and shook his head. 
"Give me the chart."
 In the exam room, the Twi'lek 
female sat on the table in a disposable 
wrap, dangling her bare feet over the 
edge. Her skin tone was teal, and at 
first glance, she certainly looked 
healthy enough. "Memah Roothes, I'm 
Dr. Divini."
 "Doctor." A cool and noncommittal 
acknowledgment.
 He looked at the flatscreen. "Says 
here that you're originally from 
Ryloth, by way of Coruscant."
 "By way of a lot of places."
 "No major illnesses or injury on the 
record."
 "Nope. I had cavern fever as a 
child?I'm from the Darkside?but 
that was common enough. Most of the 
younglings caught that sooner or later. 
Other than that, nothing to speak of."
 Uli nodded. It had been a long time 
since his medical rotations and he'd 
never seen that many Twi'leks even 
then, though he had cut open a few 
since. Her chart indicated pretty 
standard stuff. He'd test her reflexes, 
listen to her heart, and then let the 
diagnoster check the rest, including a 
broadscan for any possible pan-
species communicable diseases; not 
that it mattered much, since she'd 
already been here for a week and a 
half. Everything by the numbers; any 
third-year medical student could do it. 
He turned to the instrument table and 
fitted an auscultator to his ears, then 
turned back to her, saying, "Well, let's 
have a listen to your heart. Would you 
mind?"
 He stopped as she slid off the table, 
shucked her wrap, and tossed it onto 
the table, all in a single, smooth 
motion. Then she faced him.
 Uli wore his professional expression. 
"I was going to say, Would you mind 
taking a deep breath?"
 She shrugged. "You would have 
gotten around to asking eventually."
 Uli wasn't sure in what context her 
remark was meant, and not in a big 
hurry to find out. Roothes was 
definitely an attractive female, no two 
ways about it; still, he was a doctor. 
He'd seen more than a few beings of 
various sexes naked before. It was all 
part of the job.
 He poked and listened and 
examined, didn't find anything 
remarkable, and noted such on the 
flatscreen chart. She was a well-
nourished, well-developed sthenic 
Twi'lek female who looked a bit 
younger than her stated age and was 
within normal limits for a being of her 
species, at least according to the old-
fashioned physical exam.
 "Step in front of the diagnoster, 
please."
 She did so. The machine hummed as 
it sensed her presence on the exam 
pad. A bright light flashed, and in an 
instant she was weighed and 
measured, her various bodily 
systems?digestive, respiratory, 
nervous, circulatory, and 
musculoskeletal?scanned. The 
machine ran a battery of more than a 
hundred tests in a heartbeat, both 
generic and species-specific, and sent 
the results to his flatscreen. They 
testified that Memah Roothes was 
normal, healthy, and disease-free. No 
surprises.
 "You can get dressed," he told her.
 She looked at him. "So I pass?"
 "Yes. Everything checks out fine."
 "Two hours of my life I'll never get 
back," she muttered as she began to 
re-dress.
 Uli left the room, suppressing a 
smile. He knew just how she felt.

CENTRAL COMMAND DECK, 
OVERBRIDGE, DEATH STAR
 
 Tarkin found himself wishing once 
again that Daala were here. It 
surprised him how much he missed 
her company. She had military 
responsibilities at the Maw 
Installation, of course, but the truth 
was that the nature of that area of 
space, in which a congeries of black 
holes orbited one another in an 
elegant, complicated dance, made 
casual passersby unlikely in the 
extreme. And if that weren't enough, 
the four Star Destroyers on duty there 
were more than capable of 
discouraging any errant ships, Rebel 
or otherwise.
 And now that the station was being 
constructed here in the Horuz system, 
the importance of the work at the 
Maw was somewhat less than it had 
been. It was true that Qwi Xux's other 
projects?the Sun Crusher, the World 
Devastators, and other potent 
superweapons?were still in 
development there, as well as the 
installation being full of valuable 
scientists and technicians, but if Daala 
were to leave for a week or two, there 
would be no problem whatsoever with 
her captains maintaining security in 
her absence.
 Of course, Daala had officially been 
given express orders to maintain her 
post until relieved, since there had to 
be a ranking admiral in charge. But 
there were orders and then there were 
orders, and since both sets came from 
Tarkin, he could alter them as he 
deemed necessary. As the galaxy's 
only Grand Moff, he had extensive 
leeway in how he ran his portion of 
the navy. Nobody could question him, 
save the Emperor? and as long as he 
got the job done, the Emperor 
wouldn't care what he did to 
accomplish it.
 Tarkin stared out the viewport at the 
partly assembled battle station, and 
thought about it.
 The standing protocols at the Maw 
Installation were not open to 
interpretation. If a non-Imperial ship 
happened by and managed to avoid 
being swallowed by one of the many 
singularities surrounding it, the ship 
was to be captured and the crew 
interrogated as to how and why they 
were there. Failing the ability to 
capture it, there was but one other 
option?the vessel was to be blown to 
atoms. There were no exceptions, and 
any deck monkey with a rudimentary 
brain could follow those protocols. 
There was no need for Daala to be 
standing over the gunners repeating 
what they all already knew.
 Abruptly, Tarkin made his decision. 
He went to his quarters and engaged 
his personal communications holo-
unit, then sat back and waited for the 
connection. It was not long in coming.
 "Wilhuff! How good to see you!"
 The image of Daala over the 
holoplate was life-sized, and the 
resolution very sharp?it wasn't the 
same as her being here, but the holo 
did capture her facial expressions, as 
well as her cold and haughty beauty, 
well enough. Like him, she sat in a 
command chair.
 She was happy to see him, he could 
tell, and that pleased him.
 "And you, Daala. How are things at 
the Installation?"
 She made a dismissive gesture. 
"Less than exciting. You have news?"
 Due to the secret nature of the 
experiments being done at the Maw, 
outside communications were, for the 
most part, forbidden. With the 
exception of this circuit, Daala and 
her crew were cut off from the rest of 
the galaxy save for the Emperor 
himself, and perhaps Darth Vader. 
Tarkin could justify this contact for 
reasons of security?and, if you 
couldn't trust a Grand Moff, then who 
was trustworthy?
 "Nothing that concerns your 
command," he said. "We are winning 
the war."
 "Of course," she said with a knowing 
smile.
 He smiled in return. "We have had 
some small problems here. But 
they've been rectified, fortunately, 
with the help of a certain Imperial 
representative of whom you are no 
doubt aware."
 Daala nodded. She certainly knew to 
whom he was referring, though she 
would not speak Vader's name aloud, 
either. This was supposed to be a 
secure circuit, the signal encoded and 
encrypted on both ends, but neither 
Tarkin nor Daala trusted that. Vader 
had ears everywhere, and what one 
technician could hide, another could 
uncover.
 "However," Tarkin continued, "I 
need to give you a . . .  personal 
briefing, and to that end, I would have 
you pay us a visit."
 "Really? When?"
 "Whenever your duties make it 
convenient."
 Both of them smiled at that one. 
They both knew that, at this point, her 
"duties" were about as exciting as a 
dish of curdled droat milk. The crews 
could do disaster and battle station 
drills in their sleep.
 "Well," she said, "I expect I can get 
away starting . . .  what time is it 
now?"
 He chuckled. Daala was the only 
person in the galaxy who could make 
him laugh. Aside from her beauty, 
ambition, and brains, it was one of her 
most endearing characteristics.
 "Let me know when you depart. I 
look forward to seeing you, Admiral 
Daala."
 "And I you, Grand Moff Tarkin."
 After he disconnected, Tarkin felt 
something surge in his breast. 
Happiness? To be sure. But 
something more as well, something he 
could not quite put a finger on. Daala 
was an exciting woman in many 
ways, not the least of which was her 
physical attractiveness. But her 
ruthless-ness also called to him. She 
was the highest-ranking female in the 
Imperial Navy?due in large part to 
his machinations, of course, but 
Tarkin did not doubt that she would 
have eventually risen on her own. 
When people did not know she was 
female and judged her on 
performance scores alone, she could 
contend with almost any male officer 
in the service?and had done so.
 Perhaps she would not have gone so 
far, so quickly, without his aid, but 
without any doubt a woman of her 
skill and talent would not be held 
back. He would not have been 
attracted to any woman less capable. 
If a man could not have an equal as a 
mate, at least it was good to find one 
who could run with him.
 He looked around his quarters. Was 
it a bit dusty in here? He'd have the 
cleaning droids Come in and put it in 
sparkling order straightaway. Daala 
was coming, after all. Things must be 
perfect or he would know the reason 
why.
 He smiled. They called him old 
behind his back, but he had fire left m 
him. He was sure his subordinates 
would be surprised if they knew just 
how hot that fire burned.

CIVILIAN LIVING QUARTERS, DELTA 
SECTOR CONSTRUCTION SITE, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Teela had come to the conclusion 
that her boss liked throwing problems 
at her, just to see her initial reaction. 
This one was easier than some, harder 
than others, and overall another chore 
she could have as well done without.
 Stinex looked at her expectantly. 
"What do you think?"
 "I think you must get some kind of 
perverse pleasure out of bedeviling 
me."
 He laughed. "The older one gets, the 
harder it is to find fun things to do. 
Your solution?"
 "Tee-my. Either that, or you-buh."
 Stinex laughed again, louder. Tee-my 
came from TMAI, which was the 
acronym for Throw Money At It; you-
buh was from UABH?Use A Bigger 
Hammer. Both were terms that 
builders and mechanics liked to toss 
around. A whole lot of problems 
could be solved if one but had enough 
credits to buy whatever was needed to 
fix them. And brute force had its 
place, too. Neither was workable here 
and she knew it, but she did like 
making the Old Man laugh.
 "Seriously," he said.
 Teela stood and walked to the holo 
of the sleep-space proposal.
 Closed, it looked like nothing so 
much as a coffin, and she knew that 
she wasn't the only one on whom it 
would leave such an impression. She 
gestured, and a line of glowing stats 
and dimensions appeared.
 "Come on, boss," she said. "You 
know the stats as well as I do. If we 
try to stuff five hundred civilians who 
haven't had the training or the 
acclimation to phobespace dimensions 
into things like this, the minders will 
have them coming out their ears. We 
overload the med section, the civilians 
don't do the work . . .  there is no 
upside."
 He nodded. "Yet we have to figure 
out a way, and since I am in charge, 
I'm making it your task."
 Teela muttered a particularly vile 
curse word.
 The difficulty was that they had X 
amount of space within which to 
house Y numbers of living beings. It 
was well known by builders 
throughout galactic space that many 
species would, without sufficient 
living space, become claustrophobic, 
often violently so. Humans were 
particularly susceptible to this, which 
was a problem, as something like 95 
percent of the Death Star's projected 
crew were human or genetically very 
similar. There were ways of training 
human troops?combinations of 
hypnosis, drugs, and periods of 
acclimation?to offset this so that the 
problem would not be epidemic 
among the military contingent, but the 
civilians generally had no such 
training. Put folks into a sleep space 
the size of a coffin, and a great 
number of them would quickly 
develop psychological problems. 
Some nonhuman species, such as 
Gamorreans and Trandoshans, could 
not be made to enter such places 
voluntarily no matter what.
 You didn't want someone welding a 
critical joint at a crucial juncture of an 
air-supply line to be half crazed from 
sleep deprivation because her fear of 
tight places had kept her awake for 
several cycles.
 You'd think that on a station this 
large, the last problem they'd have 
would be living space. And yet some 
idiot who'd created the initial plans 
years before had thought that a 
chamber measuring a meter by a 
meter by two was sufficient room for 
somebody human-sized if all she or 
he was going to be doing in it was 
sleeping. Which is all one could 
possibly do in it; there wasn't room to 
do anything else. You had to crawl 
into the slot and, once inside, you 
couldn't sit up or even turn around. If 
you went in feetfirst, you came out 
headfirst, and vice versa.
 So the question here was: How to 
give the tenants more room? At the 
very least, one needed a two-meter-
square box, so that most of the 
occupants could stand erect without 
smacking their heads into the ceiling, 
or stretch out their arms without 
hitting the walls?and even that was 
marginal. You needed four times the 
room currently allotted. The problem 
was, where was it to come from? The 
available space in the civilian sectors 
had already been designated for other 
uses.
 Stinex knew this as well as she did. 
And he most likely had an answer in 
mind. But it was always a test with 
him. It wasn't as if he wanted her to 
fail; she didn't think that at all. But 
she knew he took delight when she 
came up with solutions, and the more 
novel, the better.
 This one, however, wasn't going to 
roll off the top of her head anytime 
soon. She'd have to think about it.
 She said as much. He nodded. He 
was of the measure-twice-cut-once 
philosophy, and knew that it was 
better she considered the problem 
with due gravitas rather than just 
blurting out whatever came to mind.
 "You have until tomorrow," he said. 
"Zero eight hundred."



G-12 BARRACKS, SECTOR N-SEVEN, 
CONSTRUCTION SITE, DEATH STAR
 
 Nova ducked a wild swing, caught 
the attacking guard's arm, and spun 
him into the trooper behind him. Both 
men fell, but he had no time to 
rejoice?there were others coming for 
him, lots of others. He waded into a 
pair of guards and hit both at the same 
instant with a double punch, smashing 
their noses, then dropped and swept, 
upending another one, and before that 
one hit the deck he was up again 
firing a side kick into the belly of yet 
another?
 He was aware that someone was 
fighting at his side, a human like 
himself, but huge, and just as good a 
fighter as he was. His nameless ally 
grabbed a guard by his front, lifted 
him off his feet and head-butted the 
man, knocking his helmet off, then 
dropped him, whirled, and took out 
two more with a spin kick.
 "We're having fun now, aren't we?" 
the big man said. He laughed.
 Nova had no idea where he was or 
why he was here, fighting an entire
