droid answered it anyhow. "Cross-
checking against my datafiles 
indicates an anatomical abnormality, 
Doctor."
 "Brilliant." Uli shook his head. Fates 
save him from literal-minded droids. 
But there was no time to be annoyed 
at the MD-S3. The appendix was 
swollen to what looked like four times 
normal size, though its unusual 
location made it hard to see even 
though he now knew where it was. 
His mind ran through various choices. 
He'd have to open the man up a bit 
more, or get an endoscopic arm in to 
snip and glue . . .  yeah, that would be 
the best way. Least invasive.
 "Extrude a number six endoscope 
with an SS clamp and seal off that 
appendix."
 "Yes, Doctor."
 Another thin appendage snaked from 
the droid's housing. This one bore a 
two-tined fork. The upper one was a 
self-cleaning cam lens, while the 
lower tine, five centimeters longer, 
held an open surgical-steel clamp. 
The droid deftly inserted the arm into 
the patient. The holo appeared over 
the man, showing the fork's progress.
 Unerringly, the droid positioned the 
clamp at the base of the inflamed 
appendix and then snapped it shut. A 
second arm, an endosnipper, slid in 
and, with an actinic flash of laser 
light, removed the appendix. A 
vacuum attachment sucked out any 
possible contaminants. The droid 
removed the surgical arms and tissue.
 Uli breathed easier. "Do a scan of 
the appendix for any pathogens and 
order antigen motes effective for 
anything you find."
 "Yes, Doctor."
 "Send me a copy of the lab work and 
prescriptions."
 "Yes, Doctor."
 "Okay. Close him up and have an 
orderly take him to the ward."
 "Yes, Doctor."
 Uli turned away from the patient. 
Before such things as axial scans and 
precision surgical droids, they might 
have lost this patient, digging around 
looking for a lost appendix that was 
about to pop. But the major would 
survive, and likely go on to slaughter 
hundreds or maybe thousands more 
people before the war ended.
 The irony of it all wasn't hard to see.



SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, THETA 
SECTOR, DEATH STAR
 
 So whaddya think, Chief?" Mekkar 
Doan slapped the main control 
console.
 Tenn Graneet grinned at his fellow 
petty officer. "Oh, it's a first-class 
craft, right enough."
 The two men were standing in a 
small nexus chamber overlooking the 
eight radiating particle accelerator 
tubes designed to feed the super-laser 
beam. The walls were covered with 
readout meters, fluctuating bar graph 
monitors, banks of controls, and other 
equipment. Much of it was beyond 
CPO Tenn Graneet's knowledge, but 
that was all right. He didn't need to 
know everything about how it 
worked. He just had to be able to 
work it.
 Chief Doan laughed. "You think you 
can shoot it, once everything's hooked 
up?"
 Tenn gave him a fake astonished 
look. "You shot it, didn't you? When I 
can't hit anything you can, I'll retire."
 "You read the specs?"
 Tenn nodded. "Yeah. It could be a 
planet cracker, if it works like it's 
supposed to."
 "Engineers say it will."
 "Engineers." Tenn put a considerable 
amount of sarcasm in the word.
 "Yeah, I hear that. But they're 
pulling out all the stops on this baby." 
He rubbed his hand on the control 
console. "Any problem they had, they 
threw enough money at it to bury it to 
the rails. We'll have the power, no 
worries there."
 "And if somebody didn't forget to 
dog a bolt tight, maybe it won't blow 
us all to the other side of the Rim."
 "Hey, I'm telling you, word is the 
worst piece of gear on it is still triple 
redundant."
 "I had a nephew who was a deck 
monkey on the Battle Lance," Tenn 
said.
 Doan's smile faded. "Yeah. I knew a 
couple of guys shipped on her. It was 
a freak accident."
 "Maybe. A backfire could overload 
the HM reactor and turn this station 
into radioactive dust, too."
 Doan shook his head. "Never 
happen. They got the Emperor 
himself looking over their shoulders 
on this one. They won't frip it up."
 Tenn shrugged. There was little 
point in worrying about equipment 
failure. If the thing worked, it would 
prove the Death Star to be, as Tarkin 
had put it in one of his many 
inspirational addresses to the station's 
population, "The ultimate power in 
the galaxy." If it didn't work?well, 
the hypermatter reactor was capable 
of generating an energy burst 
equivalent to the total weekly output 
of several main-sequence stars; if 
anything went wonky, it wasn't likely 
he'd be around long enough to notice. 
Nor would anyone else.
 "Yeah, well," he replied, "if they can 
build it so it holds together, I'll shoot 
it."
 "Let me show you how it works. 
You and your team will be practicing 
on the simulator until the real thing 
here's online."
 As Doan explained the intricacies of 
the sequencing relays, Tenn found it 
somewhat difficult to concentrate on 
what the other man was saying. He 
wasn't sure why. After all, he'd 
dreamed of this moment for months: 
the day he'd finally stand in the 
control chamber of the super-laser and 
be officially given command of it. 
Even though construction wasn't 
finished yet, you couldn't tell it from 
in here. He listened to the susurration 
of the klystron tubes and thermistor 
couplers, smelled the astringent scent 
of insulation lube, felt the breath of 
conditioned air adjusted to a constant 
twenty degrees, and wondered why he 
was not content.
 There was only one reason that 
seemed remotely feasible.
 The Battle Lance.
 His nephew, Hora Graneet, had been 
a navy spacer on the Imperial-class 
Star Destroyer Mark II class vessel, 
which had been selected for a 
shakedown cruise testing one of the 
improved prototype hypermatter 
reactors. Tenn didn't know the 
specifics of what had happened, and 
didn't have anything close to the math 
needed to understand it anyway. He 
knew that hypermatter existed only in 
hyperspace, that it was composed of 
tachyonic particles, and that charged 
tachyons, when constrained by the 
lower dimensions of realspace, 
produced near-limitless energy. How 
this "null-point energy" had become 
unstable he didn't know. He only 
knew it had been powerful enough to 
turn an ISD-II and its crew of thirty-
seven thousand people into floating 
wisps of ionized gas in a 
microsecond.
 So? Don't tell me you're scared, 
Graneet. You knew the risks. This is a 
war, declared or not. Wars have 
casualties.
 No. It wasn't that. It wasn't even so 
much that Hora had been a favorite 
nephew, or that the younger Graneet 
had admired his uncle so much that 
he'd enlisted, which made Tenn feel a 
considerable amount of responsibility 
for his death. It was the thought of 
that much power, and the possibility 
of it becoming uncontrollable. Again 
Tenn surprised himself. He'd never 
been overly concerned about fallible 
technology before. His was not to 
reason why; he was the trigger man. 
And he was being handed the biggest 
gun in the galaxy?with the safety 
off.
 But was he capable of wielding such 
power wisely?
 Was anyone?

DOCKING BAY 6, ALPHA SECTOR, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Daala came down the ramp looking 
every centimeter the Imperial admiral. 
She didn't just walk, she swept, and it 
was a joy to watch her stride. Strong, 
smart, ambitious, dedicated, funny, 
and beautiful? what more could a 
man possibly want in a partner?
 Well, a bit more proximity would be 
good. But they were both creatures of 
duty, and Tarkin knew that wasn't apt 
to change anytime soon; certainly not 
until the battle station was finished 
and unlimbered. Perhaps not even 
then. He knew that Daala looked upon 
him with much favor, but the 
relationship had always been 
secondary to her career. He 
understood that. More; he admired it. 
He wouldn't want a woman who 
thought any less of herself. That was 
the ultimate paradox, of course.
 "Grand Moff Tarkin. So good to see 
you again, sir."
 Tarkin held his smile in check. One 
had to be proper about such things out 
in plain sight. "Admiral Daala. The 
pleasure is mine. I trust your trip was 
uneventful?"
 "Yes, sir. Nothing untoward 
whatsoever."
 "Excellent. Allow me to show to 
your quarters. Your suite, as it 
happens, is right next to mine."
 He saw a flicker of anticipation cross 
her face?hardly enough to notice 
unless one was standing right in front 
of her. In a very quiet voice without 
moving her lips, she said, "How 
convenient, Wilhuff."
 He couldn't keep from smiling, 
despite his best efforts. "This way, 
Admiral." He extended one hand to 
show her the direction.
 She gave him a military nod, and 
they moved off past the honor guard. 
As they walked, she stared about the 
hangar, impressed. "I knew it would 
be huge, but the reality of it hadn't 
quite come home."
 "Save your awe for when it's 
finished and operational. Which will 
be quite soon now."
 "The Rebel Alliance won't know 
what hit them."
 "Oh, they'll know, my dear. 
Everyone will know. That's the 
point."
 She had cut her hair shorter than 
when last they had been together. It 
was flattering on her, but then, he'd 
never seen her with a hairstyle that 
wasn't flattering. There weren't really 
any regulations about how female 
admirals should dress or groom 
themselves?Daala was the only one, 
after all, and who would dare to tell 
her?
 She had risen on merit alone, but 
certainly her ascent to the command 
ranks had caused some speculation 
about her relationship with Tarkin and 
how that might have smoothed the 
way. Nobody speculated about it in 
earshot of him, of course. Not 
anymore, because those foolish few 
who'd done so had had their ashes 
scattered to the four solar winds. 
Tarkin had not reached the unique 
rank he held by allowing his enemies 
any quarter whatsoever. Yes, Daala 
had been his protegee, and yes, he had 
opened doors for her a bit sooner than 
she might have managed on her own, 
but she had made flag command 
without his help. There were plenty of 
male admirals unfit to polish her 
boots.
 They soon reached the door to her 
quarters. "Shall we go inside and 
discuss this further?" he murmured to 
her.
 "By all means, Grand Moff Tarkin."
 Before the door had slid completely 
shut behind them, she was in his arms.



LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES, DECK 106, 
SECTOR N-ONE, DEATH STAR
 
 The library aboard the battle station 
wasn't the biggest Atour had ever seen 
by any means. He had done his 
apprenticeship in the Baobab 
Archives on Manda, although these 
days he didn't deem it exactly prudent 
to highlight that fact on his resume. 
And from there he had gone on to be 
the archivist of such repositories as 
the Dorismus Athenaeum on Corellia 
and the Holorepository on the 
wheelworld Arkam 13. The latter was 
known for having the largest 
collection of lore on the Old Republic 
outside the Temple.
 It wasn't the most exciting of lives, 
that of an archivist, but it was one that 
suited him well. He had not, as many 
supposed, always been introspective 
and scholarly; as a young man he'd 
fought for the Janis-sariad in the 
Balduran Civil War. The experience 
had left a foul taste in his mouth for 
any and all forms of centralized 
government. Disgusted with politics, 
Atour Riten had retreated, in soul if 
not body, into the misty past. It was a 
decision he'd never regretted.
 The Death Star Library?as his mind 
insisted on naming it?was supposed 
to eschew the use of holobooks, tapes, 
and 'crons and rely instead on 
phononic lattice storage. This would 
allow storage of a huge amount of 
information in a very small space. 
Part of Atour's brief in this new job 
was to supervise the droids scanning 
information from other media into 
lattice form. Even on something the 
size of the Death Star, space was at a 
premium?at least for such things as 
data storage.
 Though he'd seen bigger and better, 
the amount of data accrued was 
impressive nonetheless. The files 
were extensive, the retrieval systems 
were thick with memory to speed up 
downloads, and the broadcast-to-
reader circuitry was top-notch. It was 
a pity that most people didn't actually 
go to libraries anymore, not when 
they could sit in the comfort of their 
own quarters and access files 
electronically. Want to read the new 
hot interstellar caper novel, or the 
latest issue of Beings holozine? Input 
the name, touch a control, and zip?
it's in your datapad. Need to study the 
history of winged intelligent species? 
No more difficult than inputting 
search parameters, then scanning the 
bibliographic references and choosing 
a place to begin.
 There were, of course, old-fashioned 
beings who would still actually 
trundle down to where the files were. 
On some worlds the most ancient 
libraries kept books?actual bound 
volumes of printed matter?lined up 
neatly on shelves, and readers would 
walk the aisles, take a volume down, 
sniff the musty-dusty odor of it, and 
then carry it to a table to leisurely 
peruse.
 There weren't many of those readers 
left, and they were growing rarer all 
the time?this Atour knew from 
experience. But there were some who 
still knew how to actually turn a 
page?and for those who were willing 
to do so, the rewards could be great 
indeed.
 Of course, Atour was no Luddite 
antiquarian who grumbled and 
inveighed against the modern world. 
On the contrary, he'd been praised by 
experts as a slicer of excellent quality. 
And it had served him well more than 
once to have knowledge he wasn't 
supposed to. One didn't normally 
think of the data storage and 
information retrieval business as 
being particularly cutthroat, but it 
must be remembered that, in Palpa-
tine's Empire, every business was 
cutthroat. And if one was the head 
librarian and archivist, such files were 
accessible, even without high-level 
clearance. He hadn't spent a lifetime 
among the stacks without learning a 
trick or two.
 Thus it was that Riten found himself 
looking at a set of plans for this battle 
station, aka the Death Star. He was no 
engineer to understand all the 
schematics, and the documents were 
fat with technical jargon, but anyone 
with even a smattering of a general 
education could see the wonder of the 
place. It was a monster in size, and in 
intent, as well as in killing ability?or 
it would be once they assembled all of 
the weaponry and got it operational.
 Fascinating material . . . 
 For more than a few years Atour 
Riten had, when he discovered such 
interesting and potentially useful files, 
copied them and logged them into a 
personal folder that was virtually 
impossible to slice. In addition to the 
best military wards and pyrowalls, the 
folder was also protected by a random 
number generated by a quantum 
computer, said number being forty-
seven digits long. Moreover, the 
program would shift each digit one 
value lower or higher every six 
standard hours, and only somebody 
with the code to access the program 
running it could keep track of this 
shift?one had to know the date and 
hour the program generated the 
number in order to follow the 
sequence. It was a slow and unwieldy 
process, hardly suitable for files that 
needed to be accessed with any 
frequency, but workable for him.
 Once the files were copied, he 
needed a safe place to keep them. For 
some time, ever since he had run the 
military base's library there, he had 
sent the files to Danuta, a planet of no 
great import or value save for its 
mildly strategic location. It was easy 
enough to piggyback the coded 
information onto an Imperial message 
comm or even a holocomm? another 
trick he had learned in his years of 
accessing military secrets.
 Someday, if he lived long enough, 
Atour intended to write a history of 
the times that had begun with the 
Clone Wars and run through the 
current conflict between the Empire 
and the Rebel Alliance. Of course he 
had to wait and see who won before 
he could get to that part, but he was 
always on the lookout for research 
material. The plans for this battle 
station, upon which the war-in-
progress might well hinge, certainly 
seemed worthy of a place in that 
research. He'd have to write the 
account under a pseudonym, of 
course. No matter which side won, 
they would want to have words with 
the author of such a tome, which 
would hold both sides up to a bright 
light that would flatter neither. Likely 
the information would be suppressed, 
but that didn't matter. There would 
always be copies of it floating around, 
and beings who wished to know its 
contents. Knowledge was like that?
once it was ushered into the light, 
putting it back into the shadows was 
difficult, if not impossible.
 Atour leaned back in his formchair, 
which offered a silent adjustment to 
his contours. Had to give the Empire 
its due?when they wanted to, they 
could provide first-class 
environments. His office was 
testimony to that.
 He gestured at the computer's cam, 
moving his fingers in a pattern that 
said Wipe all records of this access. 
The holo blinked once, and it was 
done. Now he needed to find a comsig 
leaving the station, and link and route 
his stolen files to it. Communications 
were restricted at this base, of course, 
but if you went high enough up the 
chain of command, there was always 
someone who was allowed to talk to 
someone else. And since any officer 
foolish enough to risk his career by 
stealing a ride on a superior officer's 
communications probably wouldn't 
have been assigned here in the first 
place, the techs most likely didn't 
bother to look too closely at the 
messages they were generating. And 
even if they did, they wouldn't see 
Atour's addition if they didn't know 
exactly where and how to look.
 The chink in the armor of powerful 
beings was that they believed power 
made them smarter, as well as blaster-
proof. It had been Atour Riten's 
experience that neither of these things 
was true.
 He wove a complicated two-handed 
pattern at the computer cam, which 
began scanning comm frequencies, 
looking for a ride. Eventually, it 
would find one. There was no hurry.
 Meanwhile, it was time for lunch.

EXERCISE SUITE, EXECUTIVE LEVEL, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Motti prided himself on keeping fit. 
Stripped to a speed-strap and 
drenched in his own sweat, he was 
working out in the executive officers' 
heavy-gravity room, which he'd set at 
a three-g pull. Just standing in such a 
field was an effort. Every movement 
required three times the energy it 
normally did. Even jumping was 
risky?land at a bad angle and you 
could break an ankle. Trip and fall 
and the impact could fatally crack 
your skull.
 Motti picked up a trio of denseplast 
workout balls, each the size of his fist. 
Anywhere else on the station they 
would weigh about a kilo each; in the 
HG room they were three apiece. 
Juggling them caused his muscles to 
quickly burn. His shoulders, arms, 
hands, back?all were protesting the 
effort as he tossed and caught the 
balls. He could manage the three most 
basic patterns: the cascade, which was 
the easiest; the reverse-cascade, a bit 
harder; and the shower, in which the 
balls all circled in the same direction. 
If he dropped one it was usually 
during the shower pattern, and the 
first thing he had learned when 
juggling in the HG room was to move 
his feet out of the way quickly if he 
dropped a ball. Three kilos moving 
three times faster than normal could 
easily break bones or crush toes.
 Today, despite the burning in his 
muscles, he was a machine, moving 
perfectly, and the balls stayed aloft, 
moving in sync without any flaw. He 
was aware that a couple of other 
senior officers were watching him 
from one corner of the room, and he 
smiled to himself. Being fit was 
important. If you were physically 
stronger than the men around you, it 
made them look upon you with the 
most basic level of respect: Cross me, 
and I can break you in half. He was 
not, nor would he ever be, some fat 
and out-of-shape formchair officer 
who'd wheeze and run out of breath if 
he had to climb a flight of steps.
 He began to juggle the three heavy 
balls faster, shortening the arcs, 
bringing his elbows in closer to his 
body, tightening the pattern. The 
balls, which had been flying over his 
head, settled lower, and persistence of 
vision made them almost look as if 
they were a wheel rotating on an axle 
in front of him. Soon he would be 
able to add another one to the circle 
and juggle four. It might seem a 
trivial thing, but it wasn't. It was a 
metaphor for how to live one's life. A 
man could do almost anything he 
wished, if he wanted it enough.



THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Sergeant Stihl didn't spend much 
time in pubs or cantinas. Now and 
again he'd go, mostly to show he was 
a regular trooper who didn't mind 
having a couple of brews with the 
other men, but not all that often. An 
evening spent in a cantina would be 
one in which he could have been 
working on his fighting art or reading 
some epistemological treatise. Also, 
mind-altering substances did bad 
things for your motor skills, and it 
was hard to overcome the inertia of a 
few ales or some brain-fogging chem 
once you were done. Much easier then 
to sit on a soft chair and watch the 
entertainment holos than to go work 
out, which was definitely not the road 
to mastery.
 One of the troopers in his unit had 
gotten engaged, however, and the 
shift had an excuse to celebrate, so 
Nova had gone along, since the man 
was also a student of his.
 It was a nice enough joint. Clean, 
well ventilated, the crowd noisy but 
not over the top. Obviously the place 
to be off-hours in this sector, as it was 
standing room only. And the ale was 
cold.
 He noticed a security guy watching 
things, and after a few minutes of 
surreptitiously watching him watch 
the crowd, Nova had marked him as a 
player. He stood head and shoulders 
over most of the crowd, but he wasn't 
dependent just on his heft?that was 
obvious. The man was a fighter. Nova 
didn't know which art he favored or 
what kind of combat moves he had, 
but there was definitely something 
there. After so many years of dancing 
the dance, you could tell, just by the 
way a man stood or leaned against a 
wall. It was subtle?there was an 
attention to balance and stances, a 
way of shifting weight that, if you 
knew what to look for, was easy to 
see. This guy could take care of 
himself and anybody else in here who 
might want to give him trouble as 
well.
 Except for Sergeant Stihl, of course.
 He smiled into his ale. It was only 
his second in two hours, and there 
was still three-quarters of the purple 
liquid left. He'd already burned up the 
alcohol from the first mug, and he had 
no intention of continuing to drink 
enough to dull his wits. His days of 
getting hammered in public were long 
past?what was the point in having 
skills in a martial art if you were too 
fuzz-headed to use them when the 
need arose? He'd once seen a Bunduki 
player, a guy who had won top-level 
matches, get soused at a cantina in a 
dirtside dive. The player had gotten 
into a tiff with a local, and because he 
was drunk had gotten his butt 
thumped pretty good?despite his 
skill. Nova wasn't going to find 
himself in that position, not if he 
could help it. And he didn't go to 
cantinas to fight?that was just plain 
stupid. You never knew who had a 
vibroblade tucked away in a back 
pocket, or a couple of friends who 
would jump in unexpectedly to help 
out when you squared off.
 Nova was to wonder, later, if there 
really was anything to the 
metaphysical theory that thinking 
such thoughts gave them a higher 
probability of actually occurring. 
Maybe if he'd been thinking about 
doing his laundry or herding workers 
into the mess hall, the guy walking 
past wouldn't have stumbled at that 
moment. Maybe. Or maybe it had 
something to do with Blink.
 Blink was his private name for a 
knack he had for anticipating things, 
particularly movements of opponents. 
Many times, during a fight, he would 
know somehow, before the movement 
began, that the other guy was going to 
throw an elbow or a kick. Of course, 
being able to anticipate your rival's 
next move was the essence of good 
fighting, but Blink went beyond that. 
Not even years of practice could tell 
you, for example, if an antagonist was 
about to activate a hidden portable 
confounder, a sensory scrambling 
device that could momentarily throw 
you off-balance. Or if another fighter 
was coming around the corner as 
backup to the first. But these things, 
and others, had happened to Nova. 
And he'd known. Somehow.
 Whatever the reason, he saw the 
man, who was carrying a platter of 
mugs filled with ale he had collected 
at the bar, catch his boot on a stool 
leg, and because the stool was locked 
down, the leg didn't move. The guy 
started to fall, directly toward Nova 
who, without thinking, stood, reached 
out with his left hand, and tapped the 
falling man on the shoulder, 
deflecting him to the side so that 
instead of dropping the platter of 
mugs into Nova's lap, the man fell 
past him half a meter to the right.
 The mugs flew, showering fizzy ale 
in gouts every which way. The platter 
hit the floor well ahead of their former 
owner, who managed to break his fall 
with his hands. Then, big, drunk, and 
really irritated, he shoved away from 
the floor, came up, and spun to face 
Nova.
 "You okay, friend?" Nova asked.
 "No, I'm not milking okay! What did 
you trip me for?"
 Nova shook his head. "I didn't. You 
caught your foot on the stool right 
there."
 "You calling me a liar?"
 "Just telling you what I saw."
 "You tripped me, then you shoved 
me!"
 "Nope. I just kept you from landing 
on top of me. Sorry. It was a reflex."
 The man balled his hands into fists. 
His face, already red, got more so. 
Nova sighed. He knew the signs. Any 
second now . . . 
 The man stepped in and threw a 
hard, straight, right-lead punch at 
Nova's face. Nova turned his head, 
brought his left hand up to deflect the 
fist a bit, and with the open palm of 
his right hand smacked the attacker on 
the left temple, staggering him. 
Before the guy could do more than 
blink, Nova switched hand positions 
and thumped the heel of his left hand 
into the man's right temple. The man 
fell again, not unconscious, but not far 
from it.
 "You about done, Sergeant?" came a 
soft voice from behind him.
 Nova had felt, rather than seen, the 
big security man come up from his 
right side.
 "I think so." Nova turned to find the 
bouncer looming before him.
 "Teras kasi," the bouncer said. It was 
not a question.
 "Yep."
 The big man nodded. "Highline, 
mirror-tools. Nice. I'm Rodo."
 "Nova Stihl."
 A couple of heartbeats passed.
 "You were a little slow getting here," 
Nova said.
 "Not really. I saw you come in. I 
didn't think you'd need any help." 
Rodo looked down at the dazed man.
