stand a little risk for it.
 As long as he didn't know about it.

J BLOCK BARRACKS, GUARD POST 19, 
GRID 4349, SECTOR 547, QUADRANT 3, 
DESPAYRE
 
 Sergeant Nova Stihl had slept badly. 
A dream had troubled him; he could 
not recall the full substance of it, only 
that he had been in danger, his 
weapons empty and his fighting art 
useless. That was all it took to qualify 
as a nightmare for a soldier.
 Likely it was the heat. Even this late, 
near midnight, the air outside was 
near body temperature, and the 
barracks' air exchangers were 
malfunctioning yet again. There was 
something wrong with the 
transformer, apparently; the techs had 
not been able to keep the coils 
harmonized properly. When they 
fluctuated, the coolers couldn't keep 
up, and it quickly grew hot inside the 
windowless rooms. Probably hotter in 
here now than outside.
 For a moment, he considered his 
holos?he was halfway through a 
discourse on eclectic deontology by 
Gar Gratius?but he knew that 
wouldn't put him back to sleep. He 
arose and pulled on a pair of shorts. 
Maybe there was a breeze outside; at 
the least, even though it was warm, 
the air probably wouldn't be so stuffy 
in the yard.
 He left the barracks building and 
walked into the yard, which had a 
grassy, genetically engineered short 
lawn that felt cool under his bare feet. 
The charged fence surrounding the 
compound gave off a pale glow, 
punctuated now and then by a spark 
as Despayre's equivalent of an 
unlucky insect blundered into the 
field.
 The night was cloudy, the overcast 
sky keeping it dark where there was 
no artificial light and also acting like a 
blanket to keep the day's heat in. In 
the distance a thunderstorm rumbled, 
following heat lightning that flashed 
dimly at this remove. A little rain 
would be welcome? it would cool 
things off.
 Nova timed the flashes to the 
thunder, to gauge the distance. He 
made it fifteen to sixteen kilometers, 
moving closer. It'll probably rain 
itself out before it gets this far, he 
thought. Too bad.
 There was a bright pool of light at 
the dock, where the supply ship was 
still being off-loaded. They used 
prisoners for that, droids being in 
short supply and prone to breaking 
down in the tropical heat and 
humidity quicker than they could be 
replaced. The prisoners were guarded, 
of course, to make sure none of them 
decided to hitch a ride offworld when 
the transport left?not that they had 
anywhere to go, since the transport 
was a short-hop vessel incapable of 
making the jump to lightspeed.
 Nova did some stretching, sinking 
down into a split on the cool grass, 
rolling over onto his back and then 
into a shoulder stand, then letting his 
legs drop until his knees rested by his 
ears. He held the pose for a few 
minutes, then rolled to his feet 
without using his hands.
 He felt a little better after that. His 
shift started early, so he turned to 
head back to bed. Maybe the coolers 
were working again.
 He caught a glimpse of movement to 
his left. He glanced that way, toward 
the South Gate.
 Nothing. Nova stood still for a 
moment, waiting, looking . . . 
 He didn't see anything out of the 
ordinary.
 Had he imagined it?
 Probably a flit, one of the flying 
poisonous reptiles that sometimes got 
past the fence and into the 
compound?no one knew how. If it 
was a flit, then he'd best take himself 
inside; the critters were almost 
impossible to dodge in the dark, and 
one prick of their poisonous dorsal 
barbs could put down even a man his 
size.
 Nova headed back for bed.



SECTOR N-THREE, DEATH STAR
 
 Where are the prisoners?" Tarkin 
looked back at Vader. "Don't you 
want to finish the tour?"
 Vader dismissed this question with a 
wave of his hand. "I trust you can 
manage the assembly without my 
help. The prisoners?"
 Vader could see the muscles in the 
governor's lean jaw tighten. "This 
way," Tarkin said. He was irritated, 
but did not allow it to show overmuch 
on his face. And while his mind was 
perhaps not as flexible as it should be, 
it was hardly weak. Amazing, Vader 
reflected, how many highly ranked 
naval officers did have weak minds. 
They were good at following orders, 
but he could read them easily, even 
without the Force. The language of 
their bodies spoke volumes about 
their inner thoughts.
 Not everyone here was weak-
minded, however. Quite the contrary, 
in fact. One of the architects, the 
Mirialan woman, had surprised him. 
She had put up a powerful shield to 
cover her thoughts, even though she 
was untrained at it. He couldn't feel 
the Force flowing in her?she was no 
Jedi?but her mind was strong. 
Stronger than that of any woman he'd 
encountered in a long time; ever since 
. . . 
 Vader quashed the memory that 
threatened to rise. He did not allow 
such thoughts any longer. He had 
made an ally of pain over the past two 
decades; had let the physical and 
emotional trials he'd been subjected to 
make him stronger, instead of 
destroying him. But stoic though he 
was, even he had limits to what he 
could stand.
 He looked about him at the huge, 
curved wedge of the section, which 
was slowly being filled with girders 
and columns and vast plates of 
duralumin. The observation catwalk, 
and the small area around it, had been 
fielded off and supplied with gravity, 
as had a number of other decks and 
platforms. Vader could see one 
directly across the wedge from them, 
with several people garbed in the 
traditional white smocks and gray 
jumpsuits of scientists and engineers 
discussing something. Their local A-
grav field made it appear that they 
were standing upside down relative to 
his party.
 The vast majority of the wedge, 
however, was still in zero-g and 
vacuum. Vader watched construction 
workers?Wookiees, mostly, judging 
from the size of their vac suits?
floating from one level to another, or 
welding struts and bracework. Droids 
of various makes and models also 
moved about on various errands. It 
was an image of well-organized 
industry, one calculated to reassure 
him that work was proceeding 
smoothly and on schedule. No doubt 
it had all been carefully orchestrated 
by Tarkin, but no matter. Vader knew 
that it took workers who were at least 
competent to give the illusion of 
exemplary work.
 He would return with a favorable 
report for his Master. Tarkin and his 
construction teams would be able to 
continue building the station. 
Sabotage could not be allowed. He 
would examine those suspected of 
having a hand in the recent explosion. 
If their mental defenses were feeble, 
he would pry every thought in their 
heads loose and act on what he found. 
Anyone connected to the disruption 
would be made to pay the ultimate 
price. One, ten, a thousand?it didn't 
matter how many. All would regret it.
 All would pay.

BRIG INTERROGATION CHAMBER, 
DETENTION BLOCK AA, DECK 5, DEATH 
STAR
 
 "For whom are you working?"
 Vader stood in front of the lieutenant 
who had been in charge of the night 
watch at the Despayre air production 
facility. Tarkin watched as the Sith 
Lord interrogated the prisoner about 
the evening when the ship that had 
blown up had been loaded.
 "Th-th-the Imperial Navy," the man 
managed, in response to Vader's 
question.
 "I think not." Vader's deep and 
distorted voice carried such an 
overtone of menace, it made Tarkin 
want to take a step back. Some of the 
officers behind him actually did so.
 The lieutenant, old for his rank, 
turned to look at Tarkin. The fear in 
his eyes was obvious?as was his 
desperation. He had to be desperate if 
he thought there would be any help 
for him from Tarkin. Tarkin held his 
own gaze cool and steady. The man 
belonged to Vader now.
 "Look at me," Vader said. The 
lieutenant turned back to stare at him. 
"This is your last chance." He raised 
his right hand, fingers spread wide.
 "My lord, please! I know nothing!"
 Vader closed his hand into a fist.
 The lieutenant's voice faded to a 
choked whisper, his throat muscles 
straining visibly against the unseen 
vise that had suddenly gripped them. 
"Ugghh . . . " His face purpled, his 
eyes and tongue bulged, and after a 
moment, he staggered and fell to the 
durasteel plate floor. One didn't need 
to be a medic to see that he wasn't 
going to be telling anybody anything, 
ever again.
 Tarkin said nothing. He had seen 
Vader do this before, and, as before, 
he had no idea how it was 
accomplished. Whether the Force was 
some form of telekinetic power or 
psycho-physiological hypnosis or 
something else altogether, it was 
certainly impressive.
 Vader turned to Tarkin. "He had 
nothing to do with the sabotage."
 Tarkin frowned. "You know this?"
 "His mind was weak. Easily read."
 "Then why kill him?"
 "He will be an object lesson for 
those who follow."
 Tarkin raised an eyebrow. "A bit 
harsh."
 "The incident happened on his 
watch. He is responsible. He should 
have known about it."
 There was a line of causality that 
didn't bear too close an examination, 
Tarkin reflected. By that logic, 
anybody who had been on duty at the 
time, at any point in the construction 
process, could be found guilty. Taken 
to extremes, even Tarkin himself 
might be. And somehow, though 
Vader's mask was as impassive as 
ever, Tarkin knew that the Sith Lord 
was thinking just that.
 "I will wait for a time before I 
examine the remaining prisoners," 
Vader continued. "Give them a 
chance to learn of this man's fate. See 
that they hear of it 'accidentally.'"
 Tarkin nodded. It was ruthless, but 
certainly he could see the value of it. 
After all, was not this battle station 
the grandest example of the doctrine 
that fear itself was the most potent of 
weapons?
 "I will return to my ship now," 
Vader informed him.
 "We have quarters for you here, 
Lord Vader?"
 "I prefer my own." With a swirl of 
his cape, Vader turned and departed.
 Tarkin quelled the annoyance he felt 
at Vader's dismissive attitude; he'd 
expected no less. He glanced at the 
dead man, and then looked at the 
coterie oi guards and officers crowded 
into the small chamber, several of 
whom were obviously still stunned by 
what they had seen. "Take the body to 
the recycler level and dispose of it. 
And see to it that the guards allow the 
prisoners to overhear conversations 
about what happened here?in florid 
detail."
 For a moment, no one moved. 
Tarkin looked about the room. "Am I 
talking simply to hear my own 
voice?"
 That got results. Quickly, a pair of 
guards bent to gather up the corpse.
 Tarkin left the brig, striding down 
the narrow corridor, flanked by his 
adjutants. Vader was about as 
controllable as a rogue reek, but he 
did get results. Tarkin would be 
surprised if the other personnel being 
held in connection with the sabotage 
were not quick to give up what they 
knew after hearing of this.
 If they knew anything at all . . . 
 Still, if it cost a handful of prisoners 
to help keep this from happening 
again, that was a small price to pay. 
There were plenty of others to replace 
them.



TERMINUS FOURTEEN ACCESS 
CORRIDOR, DEATH STAR
 
 Master Chief Petty Officer Tenn 
Graneet was in the corridor leading 
away from the shuttle that had 
brought him to the battle station when 
he saw a lone figure striding toward 
him, all in black, with a cape rippling 
behind. He recognized the man 
immediately, from innumerable news 
holos he'd seen.
 It was Darth Vader, the Emperor's 
enforcer.
 Son of a bantha, Tenn thought. He'd 
known the man was here on an 
inspection tour, but he certainly didn't 
expect to encounter him walking 
down a corridor all by himself, with 
no protective entourage. Although, 
given everything he'd heard about 
Vader's highly touted skill with that 
Jedi akk-sticker hooked to his belt, 
why shouldn't he be?
 Tenn kept walking. So did Vader. 
The corridor, one of the peripheral 
passageways that led from the shuttle 
terminus, wasn't exactly narrow, but it 
wasn't terribly wide, either. Tenn 
realized that Vader's course was such 
that the mysterious cloaked figure 
would run smack into him unless one 
of them shifted to the side.
 For a moment, Tenn considered 
holding to his path, just to see what 
Vader would do. It was a common 
game among navy personnel, a test of 
will and dominance, to see who would 
veer away first, and CPO Tenn 
Graneet seldom had to give space to 
anybody?save, of course, superior 
officers. Vader, however, wasn't in 
the navy, so technically he didn't 
outrank Tenn.
 It was tempting, but only 
momentarily. Vader's pace was fast, 
and Tenn didn't think the man in black 
had any intention of altering his 
course even a hair. Tenn Graneet 
thought himself as tough as a vacuum 
seal, but he wasn't stupid or suicidal. 
He allowed himself to drift to the 
right, just enough so that when they 
passed, their shoulders were within a 
hand span?actually, Vader's shoulder 
passed within a hand span of the top 
of Tenn's head. Close enough so that 
the edge of the flowing black cape 
slid over Tenn's arm and threatened to 
catch, for just an instant, on the chief's 
chrono. The material had a smooth, 
silky texture, and was cooler than he 
would have thought.
 In fact, the very air seemed cold in 
the wake of Vader's passage.
 Tenn slowed his pace slightly, 
feeling as if he had just brushed up 
against a primal force of nature; the 
edge of a hurricane, perhaps, or an icy 
comet that simply could not be 
stopped. Had he challenged Vader by 
staying in his path, he had no doubt 
that he would have regretted it for as 
long as he lived. Which quite 
probably wouldn't have been all that 
long.
 The chief resisted an urge to glance 
back. If Vader had even noticed his 
passing, there had been no sign. 
"Whoo," he said softly to himself as 
the sound of the other's boots 
diminished. That had been an 
experience he'd remember for a while. 
He'd almost been the man who'd 
tugged on Darth Vader's cape.

FLUTTERBIRD DINER, SOUTHERN 
UNDERGROUND, GRID 17, IMPERIAL 
CITY
 
 Neet Alamant was a polished fellow, 
his voice as smooth as drive lube; 
never an awkward pause or loss for 
words. Seated in the retro-style dining 
booth across from him, Memah felt 
very little in the way of trust or 
warmth for the human. Rodo was at 
the counter, overwhelming a stool and 
not trying very hard to look 
inconspicuous as he nursed a cup of 
caf. Memah wasn't afraid of this 
officious little man, but it did feel 
comforting to have Rodo nearby, and 
to have that be obvious, just in case.
 "So let me see if I have the gist of 
your offer," she said. "You want me 
to run a cantina at a military 
installation, for which I will be paid a 
fat signing bonus and a very generous 
salary, plus a percentage of the 
profits. This will entail a two-year 
contract, during which time I will be 
required to stay at this base full-time. 
Is that a fair summation?"
 "Yes. Recreational facilities will be 
available. I am given to understand 
that the installation in question will be 
on a par, at least, with this area of the 
Underground, insofar as supplies, 
traffic, and general working 
conditions are concerned."
 Memah looked thoughtful. That last 
statement didn't mean much, but she 
had lived in worse places than the 
Underground. She didn't need luxury; 
in the last couple of years she hadn't 
had occasion to visit the surface but a 
few times, and she could have skipped 
those without any real sense of loss. 
Her life pretty much revolved around 
her work at this point.
 All in all, it seemed a 
straightforward proposition. Alamant 
was not forthcoming as to where and 
what the military installation was, but 
she could understand that. There was, 
after all, a war on, and the Empire 
was, not surprisingly, protective of its 
secrets. What little clues she could 
sieve from his words, it was probably 
a naval base on some far-flung planet. 
If it was big enough to justify having 
a civilian-run cantina, it probably 
wasn't in the middle of a hot war 
zone. And if it had the comforts of the 
Southern Underground, without the 
concomitant dangers, it couldn't be 
too bad.
 Of course, this guy was a recruiter, 
and he just might be inclined to shade 
the truth a bit if it served him to do so. 
He probably got paid for every 
qualified warm body he delivered. 
Then again, an Imperial Work 
Contract had to spell out the reality to 
be valid, even these days. If you were 
in the army or navy, you didn't have 
many rights, but as a civilian you 
usually got a better deal.
 And it wasn't as if she was besieged 
with offers of work. Cantina operators 
had certain skills, of course, but there 
wasn't a formal course of study in the 
craft that she knew about, and others 
of her ilk weren't in particularly short 
supply.
 "I can bring my own security chief?"
 "As long as he, she, or it doesn't 
have a felony criminal record and 
there are no outstanding Imperial 
warrants for major crimes. An 
appropriate salary will be provided for 
such work, and quarters will be 
provided for you and any security 
assistant you might wish to bring, as 
part of the package. Yours includes a 
single-occupancy room, standard 
officer's suite," Alamant said. Then he 
pointedly turned to look at Rodo 
before looking back at her. "Your 
security guy gets his own private 
quarters, too."
 She nodded, still thinking.
 "Not to pressure you for an answer, 
but the next civilian crew vessel for 
this venture leaves from Mainport in 
three days. If you're not interested, I 
will seek another for the position." He 
slid out of the booth and stood up. "I'll 
need to know your decision 
tomorrow."
 Memah held up a hand. "Wait here a 
moment, please." She slid out of the 
booth as well and walked over to 
where Rodo sat.
 "Bad caf," he said, looking at the 
cup. "Tastes like dishwater." He 
shook his head.
 "And how would you know that? 
Drink a lot of dishwater?"
 He shrugged and flicked his gaze at 
Alamant. "What does he want?"
 "He's offering me a job running a 
military cantina . . .  won't say where. 
I need to sign on for two years, no 
leave. Pay is good, plus a piece of the 
profit, some benefits?housing, 
medical, like that."
 Rodo nodded. "You gonna do it?"
 Memah made a show of looking 
around the diner. "Amid all these 
other offers to put a roof over my 
head and food on the table? I don't 
know; it's so hard to winnow them 
down." She sat down beside him. "I 
know someone like you can always 
get a job?but if I take this, I want 
you as my security man."
 Rodo nodded once. "Okay, I'm in."
 "Just like that?"
 He grinned. "A chance to thump 
active military guys who get rowdy? 
Why not? The guys in the field 
usually have better skills than the 
benchwarmers. More interesting that 
way. Besides, I'd miss you."
 She had to smile at that. "You're a 
Branded Aesthete, Rodo. You don't 
engage in intimate relations with 
women."
 He nodded again. "Keep 'em on a 
pedestal where they belong, that's our 
motto. But everybody's got to be 
somewhere. Beauty is where you find 
it."
 Memah felt a wave of relief. "Ship 
leaves in three days."
 "No problem. I can pack in five 
minutes."
 She nodded. Yeah. It would take her 
about that long, too.
 "So I'll tell the man we'll take the 
job."
 "Might as well. Caf can't be any 
worse." He lifted his mug in a salute 
to the recruiter at the other table.

MEDCENTER SURGICAL COMPLEX, 
SECTION N-ONE, DEATH STAR
 
 When the only tool you have is a 
knife, the old joke went, every 
problem looks like a steak. Thus Uli, 
being a surgeon, was primarily 
concerned with procedures surgical?
after all, if your speeder breaks down, 
you don't call a plumber. But there 
was more to it than just the operation 
under the sterilizing lamps. Until the 
patient was back on his or her or its 
feet, he or she or it was the surgeon's 
responsibility, and there was another 
old saw that spoke to this: You cut it, 
you take care of it.
 That was precisely why a surgeon 
had to know a certain amount of 
general medicine before he was 
allowed to pick up a laser scalpel. 
Because if your wonderful cardio-
thoracic procedure to repair a 
ballooned aorta before it could burst 
in a deadly aneurism was perfect, but 
the patient died two days later in 
recovery, that brought up the third 
hoary old saying: The operation was a 
success, but the patient died.
 There were surgeons who could 
separate the two and still sleep at 
night, but Uli was not one of them. 
And so he found himself standing 
near the bed of a grizzled old 
Wookiee construction chief who had 
been involved in a nasty 
decompression accident that had 
required a heart-lung transplant three 
days past. Despite the best sterile 
procedures, sometimes patients 
developed secondary infections, and 
something like that had apparently 
happened here. The usual antivirals, 
antiprions, and antibiotics had been 
ineffective thus far, and no pathogenic 
agents had been collected. 
Nevertheless, the old Wook had a 
fever, he was coughing, and his blood 
work showed a strange shift that 
wasn't bacterial, prional, or viral. The 
patient had an elevated eosinophil 
count, hyper to the level of Second-
Stage HES. Naturally, Uli had called 
in more expert help, but the medical 
specialist had ruled out the usual 
trans-species suspects?it wasn't 
kozema, leukemia, asthma, 
autoimmune disease, or drugs. The 
only remaining possibilities were 
some kind of parasitic or protozoal 
infestation. But the QRI scans were 
clean, there were no telltale nanocam 
images, and nothing cultured out. 
Save for the elevated white cells, 
there weren't any other real indicators. 
If this wasn't some previously 
unknown form of nosocomial 
infection, the only other possibility 
seemed to be black magic.
 The Wookiee, named Hahrynyar, 
wasn't critical, but he didn't seem to 
be getting any better. He was sick 
enough that he needed to stay in bed. 
Uli glanced at the array of telemetry 
gear on the wall and stands, and 
shook his head in weary bafflement. 
No change.
 His understanding of the Wookiee 
language was rudimentary on a good 
day. He could understand "Yes" or 
"No," and a few other medical 
responses to questions like "On a 
scale of one to ten, how much does it 
hurt?" but he wasn't going to be 
having any deep philosophical 
discussions with the big furry biped. 
Fortunately, he didn't have to. He 
gestured to C-4ME-0, who was filling 
a nearby bacta tank with fluid. The 
droid wheeled over, ready to translate.
 "Good day," Uli said to the 
Wookiee. "How are you?"
 "Wyaaaaaa. Ruh ruh?" The droid's 
dulcet tones made the snarls and 
moans of Wookiee-speak oddly 
pleasing to the ear.
 The patient moaned a response, 
which 4ME-0 translated as, "For you, 
maybe."
 The old Wook had kept his sense of 
humor, even though he was obviously 
still feeling pretty bad. Uli was glad to 
see that: a willingness to fight was the 
single most important aspect of the 
healing process, no matter the species.
 "We're going to try something new," 
he continued. "We think maybe you 
have some kind of parasite. Probably 
been dormant in your system for 
years, and the immunosuppressives 
somehow triggered it. The internal 
medicine team has a broad-spectrum 
medication, Nicosamide-
Mebendazole Complex, that seems to 
work on a variety of occult 
mammalian parasites. If you have 
what we think you do, this should 
cure it."
 "Whuahh yun yorra ellihenn?"
 "Well, the side effects are generally 
mild. There are a couple that might 
cause some discomfort."
 "Arm whoon urr." This was, 
according to C-4ME-0, an 
idiosyncratic phrase structure 
indicating an affirmation couched in 
weary cynicism. The droid translated 
it roughly as "Of course there are." 
Hahrynyar motioned for Uli to 
continue.
 "Um, sometimes there's an 
associated diarrhea. And very rarely, 
it affects a patient's finger- and 
toenails."
 "Yaag?"
 "Well, the nails sort of . . .  fall out."
 "Whuahh?"
 "Oh, they grow back in a few 
months, good as new. And, as I say, it 
is quite rare."
 The next comment was one 4ME-0 
seemed reluctant at first to translate; 
when it did, Uli had to hide a smile. 
He hadn't been aware that members of 
this species were so imaginative.
 "I understand this is distressing, but 
you can't leave the unit until you're 
better, and you can't go back to work 
until we are sure what you have isn't 
contagious."
 The Wookiee scowled.
 "Hey, I don't make the rules, I just 
work here. You have a complaint, 
take it up with the Emperor."
 Hahrynyar snarled an offensive 
remark concerning Palpatine's 
personal hygiene that Uli was ready to 
swear brought a blush to 4ME-0's 
durasteel skin. Then the big Wook 
reluctantly conceded to the treatment.
 After finishing his rounds, Uli went 
back to his office and looked at his 
calendar. Barring an emergency, he 
had nothing on his surgical schedule 
until tomorrow, and that was a routine 
triple bypass on a naval officer who 
was too fond of fats in his diet. The 
man was just a hair short of clinically 
obese; a kilo more, and he'd have to 
be put on medical waivers to continue 
serving. Given the nature of the war, 
that wouldn't surprise Uli?the 
Empire's need for warm bodies in 
some arenas was critical, as he well 
knew. Short, tall, thin, fat, it didn't 
matter; they always needed more 
blaster fodder.
 He shrugged. Every time he thought 
about it, it made him angry, but his 
anger didn't matter. The war kept 
going. There were times when he 
thought he'd never get home again, 
that the war would never end, and that 
he'd die an old man on some pity-
forsaken rock in the middle of 
nowhere, patching up the endless 
lines of wounded.
 If only there was something he could 
do to change it.



COMMAND CENTER, OVERBRIDGE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Tarkin was pleased. As much as he 
distrusted Vader and his motives, the 
coming of the man in black had 
visibly improved functions wherever 
one looked. Nobody wanted to face 
the Sith Lord's wrath, and the best 
way to avoid that was to do one's job 
with the utmost efficiency. Vader was 
a catalyst; he caused reactions that 
went well beyond his personal sphere 
of influence, great as that was. The 
fear he inspired in others was far more 
than merely the sum of his various 
and sinister parts. Even Tarkin, a
