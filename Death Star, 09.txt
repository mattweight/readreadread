Grand Moff, had sensed it 
occasionally, like a whiff of ozone 
presaging an ion storm. It was odd, 
Tarkin reflected. His rational mind 
knew that Vader was only a maimed 
remnant of a man, sealed for the rest 
of his life in biosupport armor. A 
figure more to be pitied than anything 
else. But in person, the last thing he 
inspired was pity. Vader had power, 
and he knew how to use it, no matter 
if he was overseeing the scouring of a 
continent from the bridge of his Star 
Destroyer or striking a man dead from 
across the room.
 Tarkin shook his head slightly. That 
which stays hidden and mysterious is 
always more intriguing than that 
which can be seen. He certainly 
couldn't complete with Vader on a 
physical level, nor did he wish to. But 
when this dream of his became cold 
durasteel reality, Vader's vaunted 
flagship would be yesterday's holos. 
Why waste time finding and 
incinerating Rebel bases on various 
and sundry asteroids and moons 
when, with a single command, he 
could see an entire planet decimated?
 And he would have that power, very 
soon now. Repairs on the recent 
damage were well under way, and the 
crew chiefs, directing three shifts, 
reported that over the course of the 
next few months the original work 
schedule should be reclaimed. Tarkin 
had every hope that the fifth-column 
activity had been scotched. Certainly, 
anyone who came under Vader's 
steely gaze who had anything to do 
with it would be removed forthwith 
from the playing board?
permanently.
 This battle station would be built?
and when it was done, it would be the 
ultimate power in the galaxy.
 Tarkin could be patient until then.

MACHINE TOOL STORAGE UNIT ALPHA-
FOUR, POLAR ORBIT AROUND 
DESPAYRE
 
 Ratua had no specific plan as to how 
he would get from the orbiting 
warehouse to the battle station called 
the Death Star. But he wasn't stupid. 
The section in which he found himself 
was apparently dedicated mostly to 
replacement supplies for assorted 
kinds of mechanical devices. No 
kitchen stores and no weapons were 
apparent on his initial examination of 
the premises. Things didn't look 
particularly bright for his immediate 
future.
 Perhaps, though, Fem Fortune had 
decided at last "that Celot Ratua Dil 
had suffered enough by being in the 
wrong place at the wrong time, for 
three very good things happened to 
him within hours of slipping from the 
transport ship and into the warehouse.
 First, he practically tripped over a 
huge store of gas tanks, and among 
these were copious amounts of both 
oxygen and hydrogen. With two parts 
of the latter and one of the former and 
a spark?no problem, given all the 
gear available?he could produce 
pure water, which, in a pinch, could 
keep him alive without any food for 
weeks.
 Second, he found a locker full of 
vacuum suits, one of which fit him 
tolerably well, so that in the event the 
rumors were true and the warehouses 
were periodically opened to the 
airlessness of space to get rid of pests 
that had somehow managed to find 
their way within, he wouldn't freeze 
or suffocate to death.
 And third, he found a case of 
dehydrated Vulderanian grain flakes 
that had obviously been mislaid?it 
was stacked in a rack of machine tool 
parts. Add water and, while it would 
probably not be the tastiest meal he 
had ever enjoyed, and would certainly 
grow quite monotonous over time, it 
would offer sustenance.
 So he had food and water, and he 
could breathe. Things could be a lot 
worse.
 After another day of cautious 
exploration, Ratua came across a crate 
containing a general-service droid, 
and he marveled at his continuing 
good fortune. Long ago and far away, 
he had spent some quality time hiding 
out in a droid repair shop while 
avoiding the local authorities, due to 
an unfortunate misunderstanding. 
After a few days with nothing better 
to occupy his time, Ratua had taught 
himself the basics of droid 
programming. Nothing fancy, but 
enough that he could upload simple 
instructions. And general-service 
droids were often pressed into service 
as loaders.
 Now he had a plan. All he needed 
was an opportunity, which came a few 
days later?just after he had finished 
his preparations for it. How lucky was 
that?
 A troop of droids arrived on an 
unloaded cargo vessel. Seeing this 
from his hidden vantage point in a 
maintenance conduit, Ratua quickly 
activated his programmed droid and 
hurriedly donned his vac suit. Then he 
concealed himself in a packing crate, 
sealed the crate shut from inside, and 
waited.
 Now it was up to the droid.
 He'd programmed it to observe the 
loaders, see what stores they had 
come to acquire, and quickly mark the 
crate containing Ratua so that it 
appeared to contain the same items. 
Once this was done, the droid 
"borrowed" a null-g platform and 
moved the crate onto the supply 
vessel. Nobody stopped it?there was 
no reason to do so. Even if there had 
been a living security agent on the 
cargo ship, a mechanical loading a 
crate of machine parts would be what 
he expected to see, and that's what he 
would see.
 And since nobody started yelling and 
trying to open the crate, Ratua felt 
fairly confident that his ruse had gone 
undiscovered.
 The hold was airless and unheated, 
but Ratua was protected in his suit, 
and he couldn't imagine the trip to the 
station would take more than a short 
time. If he'd guessed wrong, he would 
eventually run out of oxygen, but few 
things in life were without risk. And 
so he settled down to wait, willing 
himself into a quasi-dormant state so 
as to conserve air.
 After a few minutes, he felt the 
cargo ship stir to life and move, 
presumably, away from the 
warehouse.
 Wherever he was going, he was on 
his way.
 
 
 
 CIVILIAN TRANSPORT VESSEL 
PORTMINIAN, EN ROUTE TO THE 
HORUZ SYSTEM
 
 The viewports were opaqued, there 
being nothing to see but a kind of 
impressionistic fuzzy strangeness. 
Memah had tried looking out into the 
higher-dimensional realm early in the 
voyage, and had quickly realized that 
the resulting headache and nausea 
were not to her liking. Rodo, who had 
undertaken more than a few FTL 
voyages, had warned her, but she'd 
had to check it out for herself. Memah 
Roothes had never been one to take 
another's word for something when 
she could investigate herself; a trait, 
she reminded herself wryly, that had 
led to more than one headache over 
the years.
 The vessel, while not a first-class 
starliner, was comfortable enough. 
Small but decent cabins, four 
passengers to a unit. Aside from 
Rodo, there were two other humans 
from Imperial Center in their cabin, 
both civilians contracted for troop 
services?one was a Corellian who 
specialized in recreational gaming, the 
other a woman who was somewhat 
less forthcoming as to her origins and 
exactly what her duties were to be.
 Nobody had told them about how 
long the trip would take or where it 
would wind up, but they had been 
cruising at superluminal for several 
days, at least, so it had to be no small 
distance. Unless, of course, they were 
going around in circles or other 
random patterns to make it seem that 
way. Memah didn't seriously believe 
that, though. The Empire might be 
willing to expend drive fuel and pilot 
pay to confuse high-ranking officials 
or important civilian clients, but a 
tavern keeper, a bouncer, a gamer, 
and a "dancer"? She doubted it.
 And when all was said and done, it 
didn't really matter, did it? She was 
going somewhere, and when she got 
there, she'd be running a new place 
and getting paid pretty well for it. 
Things could be worse. Things could 
be?and had been?a lot worse. At 
least no one was likely to burn down a 
tavern run by the Empire.

SSD DEVASTATOR, POLAR ORBIT, 
DESPAYRE
 
 Darth Vader emerged from his 
hyperbaric chamber, refreshed insofar 
as the word had meaning for him. He 
had been thinking about the incidents 
that had impeded construction of the 
battle station, and they seemed to him 
to be ill formed and poorly operated. 
This surprised him somewhat, as he 
considered the Alliance more of a 
threat than even the Emperor did. 
That said, he knew that the Rebel 
network, like any large group, mostly 
comprised those who were at best 
adequate to the jobs with which they 
had been tasked. There were always a 
few who were adept, even brilliant, of 
course, and Vader was sure there were 
those among the Rebels who qualified 
for that description. Those were the 
ones to be concerned about, for they 
would fight to the last breath. Some of 
the Jedi had gone down very hard; the 
Emperor's visage itself was testament 
to that.
 Before Vader had himself been 
transformed, he'd watched Mace 
Windu inflict ghastly injury upon his 
Master. Had that been a test, as Vader 
suspected, to see if Anakin Skywalker 
would commit himself to the Sith 
Lord's cause? Had Darth Sidious been 
in control the entire time, only 
pretending to be losing, and willing to 
absorb such malevolent energies 
purely to make a point? If so, it had 
been a heavy price for his Master to 
pay to learn what he'd needed to learn.
 But be all that as it might, there was 
no Yoda, no Mace Windu leading this 
insurgency . . .  no one who shone so 
brightly in the Force that Vader could 
not miss him. Whatever few Jedi 
might be left in the galaxy had 
nothing to do with this latest attack.
 He would tell Tarkin as much. The 
cadaverous administrator had little 
imagination, but he was doggedly 
methodical, give him that. He could 
keep things on track. The project was 
not slowed so much that it needed 
Vader's personal attention toward its 
completion. He had come to see what 
he needed to see, had corrected the 
problem he had found, and now it was 
time to move on to other, weightier 
matters. There was a war being 
waged, after all.
 In the hallway outside his suite, 
Vader found a captain. "Find the 
admiral and tell him we are leaving 
within the hour."
 The captain saluted. "Yes, my lord." 
He hurried away.
 Vader entered the suite. It was well 
appointed but scarcely luxurious; it 
had been many years since he had 
taken notice of such things. He moved 
to the comm station to contact Tarkin 
and tell him he was done here. With 
any luck at all, Vader told himself, he 
would not have to return until the 
battle station was finished.



GUARD POST, SLASHTOWN PRISON 
COLONY, DESPAYRE
 
 "Say again?" Sergeant Nova Stihl 
asked. "Pack, Sergeant," the loot said. 
"You are being transferred."
 "To where?" Not that he cared 
overmuch?after all, one place on this 
pestilent world was as good, or bad, 
as another. But to his surprise, the 
lieutenant pointed at the ceiling. "To 
that pile of I-beams and durasteel 
plate in the sky."
 Nova blinked. "To the Death Star? 
Why?"
 The lieutenant sighed. "These 
insignia look like a Moff's rankings to 
you?" He gestured at his uniform. 
"Not yours to reason why, Stihl, yours 
is only to do and die. There's a shuttle 
leaving at midday; your orders are to 
be on it and so shall you be. Kiss your 
favorite prisoners good-bye and stuff 
your duffel."
 Nova shook his head in disbelief. 
"This makes no kind of sense. I'm 
doing good work here; since I started 
the lessons, murders and general 
population violence have been down 
by twelve percent."
 "Yeah, and we're all gonna miss 
watching you, Sarge, but the military 
wants you there and not here, so there 
you will go."
 Nova shrugged. No way to argue 
against that. Orders were orders.
 In his room, he was able to pack his 
gear in half an hour; it wasn't like he'd 
been able to put down deep roots or 
anything. He'd supposed he would be 
moving on at some point, but he 
hadn't ever really considered it all that 
much. And now here it was, and, 
when he got right down to it, what 
difference did it make? Watching 
convicts here or working a brig on a 
station?same difference. He'd miss 
the open air and sunshine, and the 
very few folks, either prisoners or 
guards, whom he thought of as 
friends. But he could work out 
anywhere he had a space big enough 
to lie down in, and he'd always been 
able to make new friends.
 Nova looked around. It was just a 
place. He'd spent some time here; now 
he was leaving. Such was life. If he'd 
learned nothing else from his studies, 
it was that one went with the flow.
 He wondered what kind of duty he'd 
be assigned on the station. Perhaps 
he'd contact a few people who owed 
him, try to find out.
 Forewarned was forearmed, after all.

MACHINETOOL STORAGE UNIT ALPHA-
FOUR, CARGO TRANSPORT KJB-87, 
APPROACHING THE DEATH STAR
 
 The smart thing for Ratua to do 
would be to stay in his crate until it 
was off-loaded and safely in a storage 
area somewhere. But after a couple of 
hours, he couldn't stand the cramped 
monotony anymore, and so he 
undogged the hatch and cautiously 
emerged.
 Save for the droids, which were all 
powered down for the flight, he was 
alone. The ship was on programmed 
remote control, so it was no risk at all 
for him to peep through a viewport to 
see what was out there.
 He'd heard about the battle station, 
of course, even observed it once or 
twice through a dioptric scope he'd 
managed to scrounge from a guard. 
But he wasn't prepared for this. 
Though only about half finished, the 
Death Star still loomed like a skeletal 
monster. He had no idea how far 
away it was; the lack of an 
atmosphere to blur distant objects 
rendered it stark and vivid, seemingly 
close enough to touch. The scale was 
unbelievable, and he wouldn't have 
been able to tell how large it truly was 
save for the Star Destroyers and 
massive cargo ships that hung about 
the construction site, looking like so 
many children's toys compared with 
the station itself.
 Amazing.
 Ratua thought, Should be no trouble 
at all finding places to get lost in on 
something that size.
 He went back to his crate, latched 
himself back in, and began 
masticating some grain flakes.
 
 
 
 CIVILIAN TRANSPORT VESSEL 
PORTMINIAN, APPROACHING THE 
DEATH STAR
 
 Rodo whistled. "Check it out," he 
said. Memah moved to stand next to 
the much taller human. "Whoa!"
 "Big sodder," Rodo agreed. He 
pointed. "That's a Star Destroyer 
moving off over there, see?"
 "What is it? Some kind of troop 
transport?"
 Rodo shook his head. "Battle 
station's my guess. Too big for a troop 
carrier; you could probably stuff a 
couple million stormtroopers into that 
thing with room left over for a fleet of 
battleships, once they get it done?
more than you'd need for any one 
Rebel outpost."
 "But why is it so big?"
 He shrugged. "Dunno. I'd guess it 
packs a load of firepower."
 "You think that's where we're 
going?"
 "Bet big credits to boiled chork it 
is."
 Memah stared at the huge, 
unfinished spheroid, already bristling 
with armament. Once completed, it 
would probably be able to blow ships, 
asteroids, maybe even entire moons, 
into cosmic gravel. She felt her lekku 
bristle in nervous anticipation.
 Well, she'd hoped for a locale in 
which to ply her trade that would be 
safe, hadn't she?
 "Be careful what you wish for," she 
murmured. Rodo glanced at her, but 
said nothing.
 The station, already huge, kept 
growing larger as the transport 
approached.
 
 
 
MILITARY SHUTTLE NGC-1710, 
APPROACHING THE DEATH STAR
 
 Nova had seen the holorecordings, 
but they didn't even begin to give you 
the real scope of the construction site. 
The blasted thing was huge, big as a 
moon! He'd heard the scut, naturally, 
the military comm-vine was hot with 
it: the Death Star was going to carry 
an armada of ships, it would have 
more guns than an Imperial fleet, 
there were super-secret weapons that 
could pop Star Destroyers like soap 
bubbles, burn a continent down to the 
bedrock, trigger solar flares, and so 
forth. But he'd figured most of that for 
jaw-wag that wasn't worth the air it 
took to repeat it. Now, however, 
seeing the place as the shuttle drew 
nearer he revised his opinion. No way 
the Empire would spend this kind of 
effort and money if this thing didn't 
have a big trick it could pull off.
 One thing for sure: it promised to be 
far more exciting than herding 
prisoners around on a tropical 
pesthole like Despayre.
 It looked like interesting times lay 
ahead.

CIVILIAN TRANSPORT VESSEL 
NORDIEUS, APPROACHING HANGAR 
BAY 1271, DEATH STAR
 
 Commander Atour Riten?a rank 
that meant less than nothing to him?
leaned back in his seat and looked at 
the viewer inset into the bulkhead 
next to him. My, he thought. It 
certainly is . . .  big . . . 
 Of course, he had known that. 
Despite all the secrecy concerning the 
project, and even though he had not 
been cleared to top levels by the 
Empire, he had known that. One did 
not spend forty years working for the 
Library Galactica without figuring 
how to read between the lines.
 So yes, this battle station was huge. 
He had known it, intellectually, but 
the reality of being able to see it with 
references that gave one an idea of its 
size was something else entirely. 
There were only a dozen or so 
sections of it finished enough for 
normal habitation, but even those 
portions were exceedingly large.
 Atour mentally shrugged. It didn't 
matter how big the thing was, only 
that the library inside it was 
worthwhile. And this one certainly 
was, if what he had been told was 
true. It wasn't as large and 
encompassing as, say, Imperial Center 
Main, but it was much more complete 
than many planetary libraries?or at 
least it would be when he got done 
with it.
 "Big suckah, idn't it?" The man 
sitting next to him was some kind of 
construction worker, a contractor who 
specialized in magnetic containment 
vessels, a subject that had come 
perilously close, during the course of 
the flight up, to breaking Atour's 
belief that nothing was boring, 
provided the person speaking of it 
understood it properly. Flux, gauss, 
m-particle and graviton shifts? Even 
with his not-inconsiderable general 
knowledge, those technical details 
were but mildly interesting, at best.
 Still, Atour Riten believed firmly 
that there was no excuse for 
discourtesy, and so he nodded. 
"Indeed." Unfortunately, this was 
taken as encouragement by his 
seatmate to launch into an enthusiastic 
description of the power 
requirements, in megajoules, that it 
took to run such a huge station.
 Atour let him babble on while he 
waited for the docking procedure to 
begin and considered the vagaries of 
fate that had led him here, so late in 
life. That the library was a potentially 
good one had been an unexpected 
bonus, because he had not been 
posted here as any sort of reward. 
He'd been shunted off into this world-
forsaken assignment as a way of 
getting rid of him, at least in a manner 
of speaking.
 It had been, in a sense, his own fault: 
Atour Riten was, admittedly, not 
always circumspect when it came to 
controversial subjects?politics, 
government, personal relationships?
and there were a fair number of 
people who hated to suffer his 
opinions as a result. Fortunately for 
him, those with enough power to have 
him killed with a snap of their fingers 
seldom had pristine pasts. Archivists, 
as a rule, knew how to dig into data 
banks and find just about anything, 
including bodies thought safely long 
buried. And old and smart archivists 
knew how to rig dead-man switches 
so that if they themselves suddenly 
died, no matter how natural it might 
seem, the locations of those bodies?
many, many bodies? would come to 
light. Sometimes they literally were 
bodies; mostly they were bits of 
damaging, often illegal, information 
that would cause much consternation 
in high levels of government should 
they pop up on the daily holonews.
 There were a whole lot of people 
who did not want that to happen, and 
some of them were passing smart, 
smart enough to at least realize that 
promoting Atour Riten to commander 
and shuffling him off into the middle 
of nowhere to run a military library 
and archive was a lot safer than 
deleting him. And so it had come to 
pass.
 Truth to tell, he wasn't that unhappy 
about the solution they'd found. His 
glory days of revamping and 
innovation were behind him.
 Weeks where he could stay awake 
and alert for three or four sleep cycles 
and burn in a work-fever were long 
past. He could still put together a top-
rack system as well as anyone?false 
modesty aside, better than most? but 
these years it took longer than once it 
had. He was much nearer the end of 
his road than the beginning. And all in 
all, he had few regrets.
 He sighed softly. Long had he been a 
thorn in the foot of whoever was in 
power. This latest shift didn't really 
matter all that much: Republic, 
Empire, it was six to one, half a dozen 
to the other. It meant little to the 
average person struggling to make a 
life. Either form of government could 
make the mag-levs run on time, and 
both stepped on individual rights far 
more than they should. As far as 
Atour was concerned, the best 
government was that which governed 
least. Something a step or two above 
anarchy would be ideal.
 Now there was a power-hungry 
Emperor running things. Both history 
and personal experience had taught 
Atour that in as little as a few years, 
or as much as a few centuries, there 
would come evolution?or 
revolution?and this, too, would pass. 
The new rulers would start out full of 
promise and hope and good 
intentions, and gradually settle into 
mediocrity. A benevolent but inept 
king was as bad as a despot.
 The warning bell chimed, and the 
pilot's voxcast said, "Attention all 
passengers, docking will be complete 
in five minutes. Please check and 
make sure you have all your 
belongings before debarkation."
 Atour Riten chuckled softly. There 
was a word you didn't hear that often. 
Debark, from Old Low Frusoise, 
meaning "to leave a small sailing 
ship's secondary boat." Who on board 
knew that, save for himself and 
perhaps the pilot?
 Probably no one. And probably no 
one cared in the least. When you got 
to be Atour's age, you had to take 
your amusements where you could. 
Especially with a seatmate nattering 
on and on about hypermat-ter 
reactions.



MIDLEVEL CANTINA, DECK 69, SECTOR 
N-ONE, DEATH STAR
 
 The size of the station was mind-
boggling. Memah still couldn't get her 
head around it. Her tiny part of it, 
which was to become a working 
cantina, was half again as large as the 
place that had burned to the pavement 
back in the Underground, and she had 
been given more or less a free hand to 
furnish and run it. At least, so far. 
She'd been assured that, as long as she 
didn't go crazy and try to outfit the 
place with platinum draw taps or the 
like, the Empire would cover the cost.
 If she kept getting news like that, she 
might just have to revise her opinion 
of the new regime.
 Rodo drifted past the desk where she 
sat working up an order form for 
refreshments and intoxicants. If there 
was a fermented, brewed, or distilled 
spirit that wasn't in stock, she had yet 
to learn of it. There were beers, ales, 
wines, liquors, malts, brandies . . .  
both generic and brand-named. The 
legally allowed chemicals that could 
be eaten, inhaled, dermed, or 
otherwise taken were likewise 
available across the board. All she had 
to do was tick it off on the complex 
Imperial order form and then wait for 
delivery. It was apparent that whoever 
had set this station up had planned 
ahead for such things.
 She looked up from her chore at 
Rodo. "What?"
 "Contractor's on his way to install 
the tables and chairs. He says it's a 
two-day job, tops."
 "Yeah, right. And the Emperor's 
packin' a lightsaber."
 "Apparently there was a recent visit 
from the Emperor's favorite envoy." 
He cupped his hands over his mouth 
and did a creditable impression of 
Darth Vader's respirator sound. "Since 
he left, things have run very smoothly. 
I believe the contractor is sincere."
 The comm on the computer blipped. 
Memah answered it. "Yes?"
 "Memah Roothes, please."
 "Speaking."
 "This is the scheduling droid for 
Sector Medical. When might it be 
convenient for you to meet with one 
of our doctors to complete your 
physical examination for 
preadmission to the station?"
 "I hate to point this out, but I arrived 
here some days past. Besides, they 
gave me the standard once-over 
before I dusted Despayre."
 The droid politely acknowledged the 
error, citing shorthandness and 
overscheduling problems; 
nevertheless, a physical was required 
SOP. Memah could see that she 
wasn't going to get out of it; the droid 
was firm and nonyielding as only a 
machine could be. She acquiesced to 
the following day at eleven hundred 
hours.
 "You are scheduled to see Captain 
Dr. Divini. Please bring any medical 
records you have with you. Do you 
need a reminder call on the morning 
shift?"
 "No, I can remember that far in 
advance, thank you."
 She shut off the comm and looked at 
Rodo. He gave her another shrug. "I 
went yesterday. Apparently I am not a 
carrier of any transmit-table diseases 
and thus am deemed fit for 
habitation."
 "Well, if I were Sangi Fever Sal, this 
would be a day late and a dozen 
credits short," Memah said. "I could 
have infected hundreds of people by 
now. There'd be bodies dropping like 
brindlebugs in the hot sun."
 "The Empire grinds slow but fine," 
Rodo said. "And they did check 
everybody before we got on the 
transport dirtside, like you said, so 
why do it again? There's no chance of 
catching something on the way up."
 "That's the government?everything 
and everyone gets shunted through the 
Department of Redundancy 
Department." Memah looked back at 
the requisition form. "So tomorrow I'll 
go get thumped and probed by the 
medics. See if you can't get the guy 
doing the exhaust fans and baffles in 
here while I'm gone, too, okay?"
 Rodo nodded, but somewhat 
absently; his mind was obviously 
otherwise occupied. Memah thought 
about asking him what he was 
chewing over but decided not to?
when he was ready, he'd mention it. In 
the meantime, she had a choice to 
make: Corellian ale or Zabrak 
ferment?
