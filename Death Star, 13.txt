 "That would be me."
 "Maybe I might drop by?"
 "I'd like that. You're welcome 
anytime."
 Rodo bent and, with what looked 
like almost no effort, lifted the still-
confused man to his feet. "What say 
we call it a night and head home, hey, 
friend?"
 The man nodded. "Yeah. I'm very 
tired. What happened?"
 "You tripped."
 "Oh, wow."
 Nova Stihl waited until Rodo had the 
drunk firmly in hand before he sat 
again. He noticed that the other 
troopers at the tables were looking at 
him with a certain amount of . . .  
something . . .  in their faces. 
Wonder? Amazement? Respect? 
Fear?
 All of the above, probably.
 "Next round is on me," Nova said. 
"To celebrate the union of Sergeant 
Dillwit here and his poor unlucky 
betrothed."
 The men laughed, and that was the 
end of that.
 Memah Roothes was preparing a 
drink made up of ten different-colored 
layers of liquid, and it required some 
precision to keep the fluids from 
bleeding into one another. She had the 
first seven poured into a cylindrical 
crystal as long and as big around as 
Rodo's forearm. The last three layers 
were the hardest, but as long as she 
kept a steady hand, she'd manage. It 
was a pain in the glutes manipulating 
the various densities, but the 
concoction, which would serve four, 
went for fifty credits, so it was worth 
the five minutes it took. When it was 
finished, Memah sat back and looked 
at it. Perfect.
 Rodo appeared at the end of the bar 
as the server droid collected the drink, 
called, for some reason Roothes had 
never understood, "A Walk in the 
Phelopean Forest," and wheeled away 
with it. "Nice work," he said.
 "Thanks. You, too. I noticed you 
didn't kick the sergeant out?"
 "Nah. Pure self-defense. I'd have 
done the same."
 "Went down pretty fast."
 "Yeah. Guy is really good?system-
class fighter, easy. Didn't expect to 
find somebody like that out here in 
the middle of nowhere."
 "Why not? It's a warship, right?"
 "Yes, but the really good ones are 
either out in the killing fields using 
the stuff or back in civilization 
teaching it to recruits. First one is 
okay, second is a waste. Here, it's just 
unusual."
 Memah shook her head. "Males. 
Always with the violence. You want 
to go a couple of rounds with this guy, 
don't you?"
 Rodo grinned. "I wouldn't mind. 
You want to stay sharp, you got to 
hone yourself against the best you can 
find. Just friendly competition. 
Nobody gets hurt?well, not hurt too 
bad."
 Memah shook her head again.
 Rodo drifted away.
 Even though she was busy, she 
caught a glimpse of Green-Eyes 
sitting over in the corner, sipping an 
ale. Now, there was an interesting 
male. A Zelosian, he'd said; not a 
species she'd ever run into before. 
She'd warped the HoloNet a little 
looking for general data on his kind, 
and found surprisingly little. They 
seemed to be a strange genetic 
mixture of plant and animal, unable to 
crossbreed with any other 
humanoids?not that she was overly 
concerned about that, as she saw no 
urgent need for younglings in her 
future.
 She found him oddly compelling. 
Yes, he had an easy smile and a 
relaxed manner, plus he wasn't hard to 
look at, but it was more than that. 
There was a kind of . . .  resonance, if 
that was the right word. As though 
they had known each other for a long 
time, even though they had only met 
recently.
 He pretended to be a moderately 
successful contractor, but whatever he 
was, that wasn't it. She'd had Rodo do 
a little checking on him as well, and 
as far as this station was concerned, 
no such person as Celot Ratua Dil 
existed. Which meant he was a rogue 
of some kind, working the angles, and 
her heart had sunk when she'd learned 
that.
 She shook her head as she filled half 
a dozen mugs with black Mon 
Calamari seaweed mash and she 
pondered, not for the first time, the 
question: Why couldn't she find a 
decent, hardworking, ordinary kind of 
male who wanted to grow old 
together? Why was she always 
attracted to the bad boys, the ones 
without two honest credits to rub 
together, the ones with no real 
prospects?
 Memah sighed as she prepared 
another drink. Ah, well . . .  if it 
wasn't for kissing bad boys, she'd 
never get any kissing done at all. Not 
that she'd gotten a lot of even that 
lately.
 She put the drinks up. "Order up!" 
she said.
 The server droid rolled up to collect 
the tray.
 Well, she was going to be stuck here 
for another year-and-some before her 
contract ran out. Maybe Green-Eyes 
could help the time go easier.

SUPERLASER SIMULATOR, THETA 
SECTOR, DEATH STAR
 
 CPO Tenn Graneet had been assured 
that the mock-up of the battery 
control room for the superlaser was an 
exact replica of the as-yet-unfinished 
one, down to the last rivet. Every 
function that was to be found in the 
soon-to-be-working ultimate weapon 
was replicated in the simulator. The 
gunnery team would spend long hours 
training at the mock-up's consoles, 
programming the complicated firing 
procedure into their brains, so that 
when the actual control room became 
operational, switching to the real 
thing would be as easy as falling off a 
bantha.
 Which was a good thing, because the 
superlaser battery wasn't a simple 
installation. It was, in fact, far more 
complex than any gun control in any 
ship in the Imperial Navy that Tenn 
had ever encountered. There were 
banks of lighted switches color-coded 
for each of the eight tributary sub-
beams; monitors double-stacked 
around the wall that showed every 
function of the hypermatter reactor 
and generator; sensor readings from 
the heart of the reactor to the field 
amplifiers, the inducer, the beam shaft 
. . .  taken all together, it made a 
heavy destroyer's biggest gun look 
like a child's toy. Each component had 
to be precisely tuned and focused. If 
the primary beam focusing magnet 
was off a nanometer, the tributary 
beams would not coalesce, and there 
was a good chance of imbalance 
explosions in the beam shaft if the 
tributaries weren't pulsed in at exactly 
the proper time and in the proper 
sequence. The techs and engineers 
tended to wave that possibility off as 
too small to worry about. One chance 
in a hundred million, they said. Tenn 
wasn't swallowing that. When it came 
to something this potentially deadly, 
no odds were long enough. It was true 
that there were automatic fail-safes, 
but Tenn? and any chief worth his 
salt?trusted them just about as far as 
he could stroll in hard vac. Some of 
those engineers lived in skyhooks so 
far up past the clouds that they'd 
forgotten what the ground looked like. 
If a gun's designer wasn't willing to 
stand next to it when it was being 
tested well, Tenn saw no reason to be 
there, either.
 Triggering a monster like this wasn't 
like pressing the firing stud on a 
blaster. At optimum it would take 
fifteen or twenty seconds from the 
given command to fire until the main 
beam was ready to be unleashed, and 
they hadn't gotten close to that yet. 
Half the time during firing 
simulations they couldn't balance the 
phase harmonics enough to shoot the 
primary beam at all. And even if the 
magnetic ring was precisely 
stabilized, all it would take was one of 
the tributaries warbling so much as a 
microhertz out of phase, and the 
others would desynchronize as well. 
The result would be a feedback 
explosion along the beam shaft and 
back to the main reactor that would 
turn the battle station into an 
incandescent plasma cloud in less 
than a single heartbeat, and the 
Empire thanks your family very much 
for your sacrifice.
 That wasn't going to happen on his 
watch, Tenn vowed. By the time the 
actual battery was operational, Tenn 
expected his crew to be running the 
program smooth as lube on polished 
densecris plate. But they weren't there 
yet. Not even within a parsec of close.
 Fortunately, they had plenty of time 
to practice. The crew, half of whom 
Tenn had swiped from his old unit 
with help from his new commander, 
were sharp enough, but it took twelve 
people working the battery to properly 
light the big gun and make it go bang, 
and every one of them had to nail his 
or her part dead-on. There was no 
margin for error. So far, in the first 
dozen run-throughs, they had been 
able to fire the primary beam five 
times within a minute of the order. 
Once they'd taken two minutes, and 
four times they hadn't been able to 
focus the tributaries properly at all, 
resulting in complete failures to fire. 
One time the computer had registered 
a late minor beam-warble that would 
have resulted in an automatic 
shutdown of the primary power feed 
to avoid damage, which meant it 
would have taken an hour to get back 
up for ignition sequencing. And 
wouldn't that be a delightful job, 
recalibrating everything with the land 
batteries of a Rebel base spewing hard 
energy at you?
 In addition to the real problems, 
there had been a simulated major run 
malfunction with multiple beam-
warbles and disharmonic phasing. The 
computer, in theory, could have shut 
that one down in time, but Tenn 
thought that report was optimistic. In 
a real situation, with a fully powered 
weapon, that one would more than 
likely have turned a whole lot of 
beings, equipment, and everything 
else into sizzling ions racing toward 
the edges of the galaxy.
 "All right, boys, let's see if we can 
get it right this time. I want 
everything by the numbers and clean. 
Throw the wrong switch, you are on 
kitchen patrol for a week. Too slow 
on the phase-balance, better get some 
nose plugs, because you will be 
scrubbing the trash compactors until 
they sparkle. Drop a reading on the 
inducers, and you'll find yourself 
shoveling out the animal pens until 
you smell like the south end of a 
northbound reek. Are we clear?"
 "Yes, Chief!" came the chorus of 
replies.
 "Say again, I didn't hear you!"
 "Yes, Chief!"
 He smiled under the blast helmet, 
then grimaced as a rivulet of sweat 
ran into one eye. The milking 
headgear would be less than useless if 
the gun backfired, but it would make 
a dandy torture device for 
interrogating real spies. True, it was 
navy policy that gunners wear them, 
but who-ever'd designed these black 
buckets hadn't had to leave one on for 
a whole shift. They just made the job 
harder by restricting peripheral vision 
and essentially guaranteeing that you 
spent most of your shift clonking your 
head on pipes, struts, bulkheads, and 
the like. They were also hot and 
stuffy. Tenn was pretty sure some 
boot-head had designed them for 
looks and not function. When nobody 
was around, he let the men take the 
helmets off and breathe a bit, but 
given the nature of this sim battery, 
some by-the-book officer was always 
dropping by to gawk.
 "We have an order to commence 
primary ignition," he said. 
"Commence . . .  noiv\"
 He tapped the timer control and 
watched the seconds flick past as the 
chorus of reports began:
 "Hypermatter reactor level one 
hundred percent. Feeds on tributaries 
one through eight are clean . . . "
 "Primary power amplifier is online . 
. . "
 "Firing field amplifier is green . . . "
 "We are go on induction hyperphase 
generator feed . . . "
 "Tributary beam shaft fields in 
alignment . . . "
 "Targeting field generator is lit . . . "
 "Primary beam focusing magnet at 
full gauss . . . "
 Tenn watched the timer. So far, so 
good. But then:
 "We have a hold on tributary five. 
Repeat, we have orange on T-five! 
Disharmonic in the subrouter."
 "Fix it, mister!" Tenn said. He 
looked back at the timer. Twenty-four 
seconds . . .  "Get it straight right 
milking notvV
 The sweating T-5 tech tapped 
buttons, moved sliders, pivoted shift 
levers. "Reharmonizing . . .  the 
warble is flattening out?in five, four, 
three, two . . .  T-five is clean, we are 
go on T-five!"
 Tenn scanned his board. The last 
orange light blinked off, and they 
were green straight across. He 
thumbed the safety button on the 
shifter above his head and pulled it 
down.
 "Successful primary ignition 
achieved," the computer said.
 There was a cheer from the crew, 
and Tenn smiled. "Thirty-eight 
seconds. That's a new record, even 
with the glitch, but we can do better." 
He took off his helmet. "Restart it. If 
we break thirty seconds before swing 
or third shift does, I'm buying the 
beer."
 They cheered, and fell to work with 
a will. Once again, he smiled. Nothing 
seemed to motivate a crew like the 
lure of free beer.

SIM SEVEN, DELTA SECTOR, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Vil Dance was flying like a man 
possessed by an unfettered spirit, as 
well as he had ever piloted a TIE 
fighter, really sharp, he knew it? and 
it still wasn't good enough. No matter 
how he jinked or stalled or dipped, the 
attacker was right there behind him! 
He couldn't shake him?the other ship 
was like some impossible shadow, 
mimicking his every move.
 Vil did a power stall, but the bogey 
stayed right behind him as if he were 
welded to Vil's TIE. He rolled, went 
vertical?and the tail was still there. 
He hadn't fired a shot?yet.
 "All right," he muttered through 
clenched teeth. "Let's burn some g's, 
my friend." He shoved the TIE into an 
almost ninety-degree break to 
starboard, nearly blacking out from 
the overpowering tug of gravity as he 
pulled at least four g's. And the 
mysterious black fighter not only 
matched him, but made it look easy. 
Vil could almost hear his nemesis 
behind him yawning. If he could 
shake him loose long enough to turn, 
at least he might manage a last-ditch 
maneuver that pilots called a WBD: 
We Both Die. He'd take the son of a 
raitch with him.
 But it was too late for that. Abruptly 
his pursuer's ion cannons flared. 
White light filled the cockpit, and as it 
blinded Vil, he heard:
 "Your ship has been destroyed." The 
flight simulator's voice wasn't 
supposed to have any inflection, but 
Vil was sure he heard a smug gotcha! 
tone to it.
 "Sim off," Vil said. He was 
disgusted with himself. The 
holoprojec-tion winked out, and he 
leaned back in the Control formchair 
and sighed.
 He'd thought?hoped?that the 
martial arts stuff he'd been studying 
would make a difference. After a 
couple of months' worth of classes, 
he'd felt as if he had been honed just a 
little sharper. And it was true, he'd 
realized when looking at the readouts; 
the timers had verified his reaction 
time. He was faster.
 But not fast enough to ace the 
simulator.
 Ever since the newbie Kendo had 
died, over a month ago, Vil felt he'd 
been off his game. It wasn't anything 
dramatic?he could still out-fly 
anyone else on the battle station, 
hands down. But he still felt less than 
optimum.
 It hadn't been his fault. The kid had 
been reckless. He'd wound up 
chewing vacuum for it, and there was 
nothing Vil could have done.
 But he'd been one of Alpha 
Squadron, and as such, Vil felt 
responsible. He'd never had a death in 
his squad before. He felt that he 
should do something more than the 
obligatory memorial service, the 
expressions of grief to the family via 
holo. But he had no idea what.
 It would have been one thing if 
Nond Kendo had died in the heat of 
battle. But to go out on so foolish a 
thing as a training exercise . . .  it was 
so pointless.
 There were times, in fact, when the 
whole thing seemed pretty pointless to 
Vil. And these thoughts, these 
feelings, disturbed him?almost as 
much as the kid's death did.
 He'd signed up to be a fighter pilot 
for the Empire; had pictured himself 
rocketing through the cosmos, 
gunning down evildoers in the name 
of everything right in the galaxy. But 
so far, the only deaths he'd seen were 
those of a group of motley escaped 
convicts who'd stolen a shuttle, and a 
kid too cocky to live.
 It wasn't exactly how he'd visualized 
it.
 "Time of fight?" he asked.
 The computer said, "Two minutes, 
fourteen seconds."
 Vil's eyebrows went up at that. It 
hadn't seemed that long during the 
fight. That was a personal best against 
the sim of Colonel Vindoo Barvel, the 
only man who'd held his own for even 
a few breaths against Darth Vader. Vil 
wondered how he would fare against 
a sim of Vader.
 Not that he'd ever find out; he'd like 
to meet the fool crazy enough to ask 
the man in black to be scanned and 
holoed while he pretended to pilot a 
TIE. Like as not, Vader would take 
the man's head off with that fancy 
laser sword of his.
 Anyway, he'd held his own two 
seconds longer than he'd ever 
managed before. Maybe this hand-to-
hand stuff Stihl was teaching had 
some merit, after all. He felt a little 
better.
 "Where do I rank overall ?"
 "Of current-duty Imperial pilots, you 
are currently ranked nineteenth in this 
simulation."
 Hmm. "Out of how many?"
 "Two hundred and thirty-four 
thousand, six hundred and twelve."
 Okay, so that wasn't too bad. Only 
eighteen pilots ahead of him, out of 
nearly a quarter million? Certainly 
nothing to be ashamed of . . . 
 Vil sighed. He leaned back in the 
formfit. "Set it up again," he said.
 "Beginning simulation in ten 
seconds. Nine . . .  eight . . .  seven . . .  
six . . . "
 Vil took a deep breath, and gripped 
the controls.



LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES, DECK 106, 
DEATH STAR
 
 A tour had been laboring over a data 
retrieval problem for nearly an hour 
when he realized that somebody was 
standing behind his chair. He frowned 
and turned, ready to chastise whoever 
it was for intruding into his office 
sanctuary.
 But the words died unspoken. 
Standing behind him, close enough to 
touch, was a droid, one of the new 
librarian models. He hadn't had a 
chance to see one before now, other 
than in holocatalogs and sales 
material. It looked something like a 
standard bipedal protocol droid, save 
its color was a metallic blue instead of 
gold, complete with a bluish glow to 
its photoreceptors. The head was a bit 
larger also, reflecting its increased 
memory capacity. "Yes?"
 "Good midday, sir. I have been 
ordered to report to you for 
assignment."
 What was that accent? High 
Coruscanti, it sounded like. Very posh 
and clipped. He'd never heard a droid 
affect an accent before, and the upper-
crust sensibility it conveyed made 
Atour hide a smile.
 "In what capacity?"
 "Sir, I am a librarian. I am here to 
assist you in whichever way you 
deem felicitous."
 Felicitous. Not a word that one 
usually heard from the vocabulator of 
a droid. Or anybody else, for that 
matter. Sometimes Atour thought he 
was the last classically educated man 
in the galaxy.
 "Sent by whom?"
 "Sector Admiral Poteet, sir."
 "I see. And your name?"
 "I am model P-RC-three."
 "No, no, not your model number. 
Your name."
 "I have no name, sir." The polished 
tone sounded somehow disapproving. 
"I am a droid."
 "Who programmed you?"
 "My primary programming was 
installed by Lord Alferon Choots 
Bemming, the owner and chief 
operating officer of Bibliotron 
Systems."
 Ah. "On Imperial Center."
 "Yes, sir." Again the subtle subtext, 
which managed this time to imply, 
Where else?
 Atour had, of course, heard of Lord 
Alferon, the amateur inventor and heir 
to the Bemming Shipping fortune. 
The family owned one of the largest 
private libraries of hard-copy books in 
the galaxy, more than seven million 
volumes, some ranging back to the 
Golden Age. Lord Alferon was 
supposedly so rich that he could buy a 
planet, cover it knee-deep in precious 
jewels and metals, and then use the 
rumored doomsday weapon on this 
battle station to blow it all to atoms 
without putting a noticeable dent in 
his exchequer. He was also something 
of a tinkerer, and owned a droid-
design company where he spent much 
of his personal time. Atour thought 
wistfully of the rich man's library. 
There were people who would kill to 
work there, and he was foremost 
among them. Seven million books. He 
sighed. It made one's heart ache.
 "All right, then. Henceforth, you will 
answer to the name 'Persee.' Unless 
you have some objection?"
 "No objection, sir." Was the droid's 
tone slightly icier? Well, if so, that 
was just too bad.
 "Good," Atour said. "Now come 
here and make yourself useful. There 
is a bottleneck in this access system, 
here?" He pointed at the holoscreen. 
"?and I want it eliminated. Find a 
way."
 "Very good, sir. Will that be all for 
now?"
 "That's enough, I imagine. How long 
do you estimate it will take?"
 The droid stepped forward and 
touched several controls on the holo-
console, then watched as a crawl of 
words and numbers scrolled up so fast 
that no human could possibly read 
them. After a few seconds it touched a 
second control. The alphanumerics 
stopped, and the droid stood there 
silently.
 Atour counted slowly to five. "You 
were going to give me an estimate of 
the time necessary to clear the 
bottleneck."
 "Unnecessary, sir. The problem has 
been cleared."
 Atour blinked. "Really?"
 "Of course, sir. Will there be 
anything else?"
 Atour smiled. A competent assistant! 
How wonderful! Better a single droid 
that knew what it was doing than any 
number of fumbling organic beings. 
"No, I think that will do for now. 
Thank you, Persee. I appreciate it."
 "It is my function, sir. Would you 
care for some tea while you determine 
my next chore? I have checked the 
kitchen stores, and can offer you a 
choice of Manellan Jasper, Kosh, 
Bluefruit Kintle . . . "
 Now Atour Riten laughed aloud. 
Perhaps this post wouldn't be so 
onerous after all.

DOCKING BAY 35, IMPERIAL-CLASS 
STAR DESTROYER UNDAUNTABLE
 
 Admiral Motti was pleased that 
Admiral Helaw had done such a good 
job with the Undauntable. She was an 
old ship, on the line for a decade 
before any other in this quadrant, and 
despite that, she gleamed like a shiny 
new credit coin. All systems were in 
order, and Helaw, who was going to 
retire as soon as this project was 
finished, was old school, a man who 
had earned his flag rank on the front 
lines of a dozen major battles. When 
the guns started working, you wanted 
a man like him watching your back?
he'd take the beam in his own chest 
before he allowed it to hit you from 
behind.
 As the two men walked down the 
corridor to the docking bay where 
Motti's lighter waited, their talk was 
easy and informal. They went way 
back?Helaw had been a captain on 
the Ion Storm when Motti had gotten 
his promotion to first lieutenant. That 
Motti had eventually done a desk tour 
on Imperial Center and made contacts 
that allowed him to rise past his old 
commander spoke to his ambition and 
intelligence in such matters. Helaw 
had never enjoyed politics, even 
though Motti had tried to interest him. 
The older man just didn't care?all he 
wanted to do was take his ship out 
and smoke the enemy, and he was as 
good at it as any man in the navy. 
Assigning him a desk would have 
been a waste, Motti knew, even 
though he would have been a 
formidable Moff, had he wanted to go 
down that road. Better by far than 
Tarkin, whose political skills were 
superior to Motti's own, but whose 
grasp of working strategy and tactics 
was much inferior to Helaw's.
 "So you think this big tank of a 
station Wilhuff is building is coming 
along all right?"
 "It is. And now that I'm aboard, it 
will do so even faster."
 Helaw laughed. "Never a lack of 
self-confidence in you. Zi."
 Motti smiled in return. "You know 
what they say: Sometimes wrong, but 
never in doubt."
 "I still think it's putting too many 
spawns in one bin."
 "Come on, Jaim, you've seen the 
specs, even though you weren't 
supposed to. The station is a fortress. 
It has more guns than a fleet, and a 
weapon that will crack open worlds 
like they were ripe wuli nuts. Nothing 
the Rebels can throw at it will slow it 
down by as much as a meter. Nothing 
we have will give it pause. Whatever 
else he might be, Wilhuff's ideas 
about this are solid. The Rebels won't 
be able to run fast enough, and if we 
can blow a planet out from under 
them, where can they hide?"
 "Maybe."
 They were almost to the deck. Motti 
turned to look at his old commander. 
"'Maybe?'"
 "Did I ever tell you 'bout Lieutenant 
Pojo?"
 "I don't think so."
 "Thirty-five, forty years back, Kan 
Pojo was the range officer and small-
arms instructor on the training ship 
Overt. He was fleet champion with 
any arms you could carry?carbine, 
sniper rifle, sidearm. He could use a 
blast pistol to pick flies off a wall at 
ten paces. I never saw a man who 
could shoot as well as he did. It was 
uncanny."
 "Uh-huh." Motti resisted the urge to 
yawn. He admired and respected Jaim 
Helaw as he did few men, but the old 
trooper did take his time spinning a 
yarn.
 "We ran into a bit of trouble in the 
Vergesso?pirates had taken over a 
moon. We were sent down to teach 
them the error of their ways."
 Motti nodded. "And?"
 "Pojo wanted to get into the fray. It 
was a lot of close-quarters stuff: the 
only city on the moon was domed?
we're talking a maze of alleys and 
narrow streets. Nobody could use big 
guns, because anything larger than a 
blaster rifle might rupture the dome. 
So the CO thought, Why not?
 "I was doing a tour as a naval 
adjunct, a second loot, and Pojo was 
assigned to our squad. So we drop, 
access the dome, and start hunting 
pirates. They were a ratty bunch, 
maybe a hundred, hundred and twenty 
of 'em, but spread out.
 "Our squad came across a group of 
'em, about twenty-five men, and we 
all commenced to have a shootout. 
Pojo was knocking them down, left, 
right, and center, like targets on the 
range. Only thing I've ever seen to 
compare it to is that old holo of Phow 
Ji taking out the mercenaries. Ever 
seen it?"
 Motti nodded. What soldier hadn't?
 "So Pojo takes out half the group 
before any of us can even crank up 
our guns, using nothing but his 
sidearm?a blaster modified with a 
heavy-duty capacitor to fire more
