efficient, and he usually tuned it out. 
Now and again, however, usually 
during quiet or contemplative 
moments, it would intrude, reminding 
him that it was the will of his Master 
that he had become what he had 
become. In many ways, so much less 
than he had been before.
 And in other ways, so much more . . 
. 
 The creation and construction of the 
suit had been perforce hasty, since the 
maimed and burned thing that had 
been Anakin Skywalker was dying, 
and would not have survived for long 
even in a bacta tank. There had been 
no time to tailor all the life-support 
systems specifically to his needs. 
Many of the suit's features were 
adapted from earlier technology, such 
as had been designed for the cyborg 
droid General Grievous over two 
decades before. It was hardly state-of-
the-art. It could, Vader knew, be 
rebuilt now and made infinitely better, 
more comfortable, and more 
powerful. There was only one 
problem with doing so: to be 
completely excised, even temporarily, 
from the suit would kill him. Not even 
the safety of the hyperbaric 
chamber?indeed, not even his 
command of the dark side?could 
ensure his protection during such a 
procedure.
 Like it or not, the suit and he were 
one, now and forever.
 "Lord Vader," came the voice of the 
Devastator's captain from behind him. 
There was only the smallest hint of 
fear in it, but even that much was 
obvious to one steeped in the dark 
side of the Force. Vader felt it as an 
icy frisson along his nerves, a 
plangent chord that he alone could 
hear, a flash of lightning across a 
darkling plain. Fear was good? in 
others.
 "Yes?"
 "We are approaching the drop back 
into realspace."
 Vader turned and regarded the man. 
"And?"
 Captain Pychor swallowed. "N-
nothing else, my lord. I just thought to 
inform you."
 "Thank you, Captain. I am already 
aware of it."
 "Yes, my lord." The captain bowed, 
and backed away.
 Inside the helmet, Vader smiled, 
though it caused him pain to make the 
expression. But pain was always with 
him; a little more meant nothing. It 
wasn't even necessary to call upon the 
dark side to deal with it. It was purely 
a matter of will.
 The smile faded as he contemplated 
the immediate future. This trip, he 
felt, should not be necessary. 
Governor Wilhuff Tarkin?"Grand 
Moff Tarkin," as he had been recently 
designated; a ridiculous rank, in
 Vader's opinion?knew his duty. He 
had been charged by the Emperor to 
create this behemoth that was 
supposed to strike fear into the hearts 
of the Rebels, and certainly he knew 
what would happen to him if he failed 
in his duty. Tarkin's philosophy was 
sound: fear was a useful tool. And the 
battle station would undoubtedly be 
useful, though the power all its 
vaunted weaponry and battleships 
could produce paled against the power 
of the Force. But the Emperor wished 
it, and so it would happen.
 There had been, however, 
setbacks?accidents, sabotage, 
delays? and these were troubling to 
the Emperor. And so Palpatine had 
sent Vader to once again convey his 
displeasure at these setbacks to 
Tarkin's pet project, and to suggest?
strongly?that the Grand Moff find 
ways to avoid them in the future.
 Tarkin was no fool. He would 
understand the message: Fail, and 
suffer the consequences.
 The Devastator segued from the 
hallucinogenic chaos of hyperspace to 
the more stable vista of realspace. 
Vader turned away from the view, his 
cape swirling about him. Now that 
they were nearly at their destination, 
he would be able to spend a few hours 
in his hyperbaric chamber, free at 
least of his helmet. Time to reflect on 
his memories, to allow his anger and 
rage to rise, and for a brief time the 
dark side would feed on that rage and 
free him of constant pain. The healing 
never lasted, however. It was 
impossible to maintain for long, even 
within the confines of the chamber. 
As soon as his anger ebbed and his 
concentration lapsed, he reverted to 
what he had become?to what Obi-
Wan Kenobi, his erstwhile Jedi 
Master, had made of him.
 Most of the Jedi had been destroyed. 
Some of the few who mattered the 
most, however, had not. Some had 
escaped, among them Yoda. This was 
disturbing. Old as the green little imp 
with the querulous voice was, he 
could still be a threat.
 More important, though, was the 
knowledge that Vader's nemesis still 
lived. He would have felt it through 
the Force if the old man had died, of 
that he was certain. And this was a 
good thing, a very good thing indeed. 
Because someday, somehow, Obi-
Wan Kenobi would pay for what he 
had done to Anakin Skywalker, and it 
would be Darth Vader who collected 
the toll. He would strike down Kenobi 
as he had so many of his fellow Jedi, 
be they Masters, Knights, or 
Padawans. Eventually the inevitable 
would become reality, and the Jedi 
would be no more.
 That thought was worth another 
painful smile behind the ebon mask.

GRAND MOFF'S SUITE, LQ FLAGSHIP 
HAVELON
 
 "Sir, there has been . . .  an incident."
 Seated behind his desk next to the 
panorama of his viewport, which 
occupied most of the wall to his right, 
Tarkin stared at the captain. "An 
incident?"
 "Yes, sir. An explosion in the 
oxygen supply tanker arriving from 
the planet. It was just off the 
northeastern quadrisphere's Main 
Dock when it happened."
 "How much damage?"
 "Uncertain, sir. There is still a lot of 
debris flying about. The tanker was 
destroyed. Fortunately, most of the 
crew were only droids. A few navy 
beings and officers?"
 "Don't address trivial matters, 
Captain. How much damage to the 
station?"
 "So far, what we know for sure is 
that the dock portal and bay took the 
brunt of the explosion. Our security 
teams can only guess at?"
 "Then do so."
 The captain looked uneasy. Officers 
had been sent to the front for lesser 
offenses than delivering bad news, 
and he knew it. No doubt this was 
why the admiral in charge of security 
had not come to deliver the report 
himself.
 "Sir, both the portal and dock are 
demolished. The bay is a mass of 
twisted girders and ruptured plates. 
Easier to tear it apart and start from 
scratch than to repair them."
 Tarkin would have spoken aloud the 
curse that rose from his throat had he 
been alone. But of course, a mere 
captain could not be privy to such 
utterances from a Grand Moff. He 
simply said, "I see."
 "Emergency construction teams have 
arrived and are doing an assessment," 
the captain continued. "A full report 
will be tendered as soon as possible."
 Tarkin nodded. Outwardly, he was 
calm, collected. His voice was cool 
and even as he said, "I want the cause 
determined, Captain. Without delay." 
A millimeter below the surface, 
however, he was seething with rage. 
How dare anyone damage a single 
bolt, or rivet, or weld of his station!
 "Of course, sir," the officer replied.
 "If it was a failure due to someone's 
error, I want to know. If it was 
sabotage, I will have the entire life 
history?or histories?of whoever 
caused it, and the name of the senior 
officer who slipped up and allowed it 
to happen."
 "Yes, sir."
 "You are dismissed, Captain."
 "Sir!" The captain saluted, turned, 
and departed, a lot quicker on his feet 
than when he'd arrived.
 Tarkin stood and stared through the 
viewport at the infinite blackness, 
shot with points of light. So cold and 
empty out there. Well, before too long 
it would be fuller, by an infinitesimal 
degree, with the frozen and contorted 
body, or bodies, of whoever was 
responsible for this outrage. 
Retribution would be swift and 
certain. That was the only way there 
would be even a remote possibility of 
making other would-be saboteurs 
think twice about imitating such a 
heinous act.
 At times like this, he wished Daala 
were here. Clever, beautiful, and 
utterly ruthless when the situation 
demanded it, she could be most 
diverting?a great relief for a man 
such as himself, beset on all sides as 
he was with weighty problems. But 
the only female admiral in the 
Imperial Navy was still stationed at 
the Maw with her four Destroyers, 
protecting the hidden base where the 
battle station's plans and weaponry 
were in ongoing development.
 Abruptly, Tarkin made a decision. 
He waved his hand over the comm on 
his desk.
 "Sir?" came the immediate query 
from his aide.
 "Is my ship prepared?"
 "Of course, sir." The aide's tone was 
polite, but with just a bit of surprise to 
indicate what an unnecessary question 
it was.
 "Meet me at the flight deck."
 "Yes, sir." Cautiously: "Might one 
ask where we are going?"
 "To inspect the damage to the battle 
station from the explosion. I want to 
see it for myself."
 "Yes, sir."
 Tarkin stood, feeling a glow of fierce 
satisfaction. He had not always been a 
desk-bound commander. He had spent 
plenty of time in the field. Now and 
again it served the rank and file to 
know that he was still capable of 
getting his hands dirty?or bloody, 
depending on the situation.

GRAND MOFF'S LIGHTER, 0.5 
KILOMETERS FROM THE DEATH STAR
 
 "Look to the forward viewport, sir," 
the pilot said.
 Tarkin, who had been poring over a 
schematic hologram of the station that 
showed where the damage was, 
turned and stared through the port at 
the real thing.
 It was indeed a mess. It appeared as 
if a giant hand had smashed the dock, 
then petulantly ripped sections of it 
loose and flung those into space. 
Debris of all sizes and shapes whirled 
and tumbled aimlessly, not having 
had time yet to settle into any sort of 
orbit.
 Tarkin's expression was pinched 
tight in anger, but his voice was level 
as he said, "Bring her around and let's 
have a closer look."
 "Sir." A pause. "There's a lot of 
debris, sir."
 "I can see that. I suggest you avoid 
running into it."
 The pilot swallowed dryly. "Yes, 
sir."
 As the pilot began to swing the small 
cruiser into a wide turn, Tarkin's aide 
approached.
 "Yes, Colonel?"
 "The forensic investigation team has 
a preliminary report, sir."
 "Really? This soon?"
 "You did indicate a desire for 
alacrity, sir."
 "Indeed." Tarkin offered the colonel 
a small, tight smile. "Hold off on the 
flyby," he instructed the pilot. "I'll 
take the report here."
 "Sir." The pilot was visibly relieved 
at this.
 A moment later, the holoprojector lit 
over the command console at which 
Tarkin stood, displaying a one-third-
sized image of a security force major 
standing at attention.
 "Sir," the major said, giving a 
military bow.
 Tarkin made an impatient gesture. 
"What do we have, Major?"
 The major reached off-image to 
touch a control, and a second 
holoimage blossomed next to him. It 
was that of an Imperial gas tanker. As 
Tarkin watched, the images grew 
larger and translucent as the point of 
view zoomed closer. A flashing red 
dot appeared toward the rear of the 
ship, and the POV zoomed in closer 
still to reveal the interior of the vessel.
 "From the dispersal pattern of the 
ship's interior and hull, which we 
backtracked by computer 
reconstruction, the source of the 
explosion was here?" The officer 
pointed into the hologram, only his 
hand and pointing finger becoming 
visible in the blown-up image before 
Tarkin's eyes. "?in the aft cargo 
hold. The precise location was plus or 
minus a meter of the pressure valve 
complex on the starboard tank array."
 "Go on."
 "Given the size of the tanks and the 
pressure?the oxygen is liquefied, of 
course?and the estimated explosive 
potential and expansion, we have 
calculated that a leak and subsequent 
accidental ignition of expanding gas 
in an enclosed compartment is highly 
unlikely to have produced the level of 
damage recorded."
 Tarkin nodded, almost to himself. 
"Sabotage, then," he said. "A bomb."
 "We believe so, sir." The image 
zoomed back out to encompass the 
major again. "We have not yet 
recovered parts of the device itself, 
but we will."
 Tarkin gritted his teeth, feeling his 
jaw muscles bunch. He made an effort 
to relax, giving the major another of 
his tight smiles. "Congratulate your 
team on their efforts thus far, Major. I 
am pleased with your efficiency."
 "Thank you, sir." The man smiled.
 "But don't pat yourselves on the 
backs too much just yet. I want to 
know what kind of bomb it was, who 
made it, who planted it? everything."
 The major stiffened again. "Yes, sir. 
We will report as soon as we have 
new information."
 "You're already late with it," Tarkin 
said. "Dismissed."
 The holo blinked off, and Tarkin 
stared into the blank space that was 
left, as if looking for answers. 
Sabotage was, of course, to be 
expected. This wasn't the first time it 
had happened, and it almost certainly 
would not be the last. A project this 
size, no matter how tight the security, 
was impossible to keep entirely 
hidden. An astute observer could 
gather a number of disparate facts 
from far-flung sources?shipping 
manifests, troop movements, vessel 
deployments, and the like?and from 
those, if he had even the cleverness of 
a sunstroked Gungan, deduce some 
general ideas. He might not know 
exactly what, or precisely where, but 
he could figure out that something big 
was being constructed. And with 
sufficient resources, time, and 
cunning, this being, and others like 
him, could discover a trail that led 
back to this system and this station.
 There were shrewd beings among 
the Rebels; Tarkin had no doubt of 
that. And there were, more than 
likely, Rebels among the human 
detritus down on the prison planet. 
Perhaps even traitors among the 
Imperial Navy or troops.
 A very tight lid was being kept on 
this project. Communications had 
been, and continued to be, squeezed 
tighter than a durasteel fist. But 
somebody had blown up that cargo 
ship, and had not done so just because 
they were bored and had nothing 
better to do.
 Such travesties could not be abided. 
Nor would they be.

INTERIOR OFFICE ANNEX, ASSEMBLY 
HALL, CONSTRUCTION SITE BETA-
NINE, DEATH STAR
 
 He had a name?Benits Stinex, and 
anybody who knew anything about 
architecture recognized it. Stinex? Oh, 
sure, the designer. The one who still 
gets written up regularly in Beings 
Holozine. The one whose price was 
always more than one could imagine, 
let alone afford. Among themselves, 
the staff doing the interiors referred to 
him as "the Old Man." Old he was, 
too?Teela guessed his age at three, 
maybe four times her own, and she 
was nearing twenty-five standard 
years. Human, with more wrinkles 
than hyperspace, the chief architect 
was; the head of interior design and 
construction, and still mentally as 
sharp as a vibroblade.
 He waved at the holo, which 
glimmered blue and white over the 
projector in front of them, depicting 
the schematics for the finished 
assembly hall. "What do you think, 
Kaarz?"
 Standing next to him in the recently 
pressurized but still-cold office annex, 
Teela knew she was once again being 
tested. Every time she was around the 
Old Man, he did that. She'd heard that 
it took awhile for him to trust you?
but once he did you were golden in 
his eyes. It seemed that everybody 
worth the salt in their bodies who 
worked for him wanted him to feel 
that way.
 And why shouldn't they? A missive 
of recommendation from Stinex, even 
just a line or two, was worth just 
about any conceivable torture one 
could imagine and endure. It was a 
ticket for the hyperlane that could 
lead to wealth, fame, and the most 
desirable thing of all:
 Freedom.
 The freedom to design what one 
wished, to give free rein to one's 
artistic expression, to create 
something that might truly outlast the 
ages, that might?
 Teela realized that the Old Man was 
waiting patiently for an answer to his 
question. She shrugged. "It's standard 
Imperial design; works enough to 
serve."
 The Old Man gave her a slow, 
disappointed look.
 "But," she continued, "if you want it 
to work well, then the egress and exit 
portals need to be relocated." She 
pulled the finger-sized electronic 
scribe from her belt, thumbed the 
eraser stud, and waved it at the 
drawing. "Here, here, and here," she 
continued, "and possibly there, as 
well." The portals vanished as she 
gestured, replaced by skeletal wall 
lines. Quickly she sketched in new 
doors. "Reposition these portals, skew 
the walkways, like so, the flow-
through improves at least twenty-five 
percent, like the presentation says. 
Doesn't cost any more."
 The Old Man smiled and nodded, 
pleased. "What about the ventilation?"
 "Specs call for a superannuated 
System Four and what you need is a 
minimum of a Five. A Six would be 
better."
 "The Empire deems a Four 
adequate."
 "The idiot who drew up the 
engineering specs was interested in 
saving money?if he had to sit in this 
hall with four thousand other beings, 
each putting out between sixty and a 
hundred and forty watts of heat and 
copious amounts of carbon dioxide, 
not to mention various body odors, 
while listening to some long-winded 
admiral blather on for two hours, he'd 
upgrade the air exchangers as soon as 
he could get to a requisition form."
 The Old Man laughed. "I can see 
why you were sent to prison. Political 
delicacy is not one of your strong 
points, is it?"
 She shrugged. "Form follows 
function."
 "The defense of the idealist. I will 
grant you that the Empire is slow to 
learn basic architectural concepts." He 
nodded at the three-dimensional 
image. "All right. Make the portal 
changes. I'll allow a Five for the 
exchangers. What else?"
 Teela could not stop her grin. She 
was a political prisoner of the Empire, 
but at least she was being allowed to 
do work she knew how to do. As vast 
as the project was, they needed all the 
help they could get, and she was very 
good at her job. The Old Man knew it, 
even though he kept verbally poking 
at her every time they spoke. He 
himself was a willing tool of the 
Empire, but he had designed 
everything from refreshers to 
superskytowers, skyhooks to sports 
stadiums, and he had forgotten more 
than most architects learned in a 
lifetime of study. She had trained with 
some of the best, and she knew the 
hand of a master when she felt it. She 
didn't enjoy being tested like a third-
year arcology student this way, but 
she also felt a little surge of pride 
every time the Old Man smiled and 
nodded at one of her suggestions. It 
was good to be acknowledged by 
someone of his ability.
 As she pointed out other 
inefficiencies in the standard design, 
however, she felt it again: that tiny 
twinge, that brief moment of 
discomfort. She was working for the 
Empire, a thing she had sworn she 
would never do, helping design a 
vessel that would, in all probability, 
be the most fearsome weapon the 
galaxy had ever seen. While it was 
true that improving the biometrics and 
seating pattern in an assembly hall 
was not the same as devising a 
superlaser that could melt moons, still 
. . . 
 Still, one was either a factor in 
something's success, or a factor in its 
failure.
 Working for the enemy, said the little 
voice she sometimes heard in her 
head. She often visualized it as a 
miniature version of herself, shaking a 
chastising finger. How sad is that?
 Not as if I had a choice, is it? she 
replied mentally. Nobody asked me if 
I wanted the job, now, did they?
 You could have turned it down, the 
avatar of her conscience shot back.
 And been sent back to that serpent's 
nest of a planet to rot and die? To 
what end?
 Her inner self fell silent.
 "We can't do that," the Old Man said 
to her suggestion of natural lighting in 
the complex. "I have limits."
 She nodded. She had thought that 
would be his response, but there was 
no harm in asking. The Old Man had 
considerable power when it came to 
design alterations. Several times Teela 
had seen specifications upgraded and 
improved to heights well beyond what 
she had expected.
 This project had support at the 
highest levels. While the admirals 
who controlled the credits were 
always trying to pinch and hold on to 
as many as they could, nobody was 
going to stint on anything that would 
make it function as intended.
 Too bad the original designers hadn't 
had that mandate.
 Teela hadn't seen all of the master 
plans?she didn't think anybody 
below the Old Man's standing had 
seen all of them?but there were 
plenty of design flaws in the subplans 
she had reviewed. Nothing so major 
that the place would fail to function or 
fall apart if somebody bumped into a 
wall, but enough little bits and pieces 
here and there said without a doubt 
that the designers had paid less 
attention to details than they should 
have. Another draft or two of the 
schematics would have corrected 
most of those; many were being 
caught and fixed on the fly, such as 
she had just done?poorly placed 
entrances and exits, less-than-
adequate ventilation systems, thermal 
vents badly located . . .  the usual 
minutiae that cropped up in big 
construction projects. There was just 
more of it, but then there was a lot 
more vessel for mistakes to happen in, 
wasn't there? This Death Star was, 
after all, as big as a Class IV moon, 
with a minimum of over a million 
beings making up the crew. Nothing 
this size had ever been built before . . 
.  at least as far as Teela was aware.
 What it all came down to was, she 
would do what she could do. Working 
for the Empire was bad, no getting 
around that, but not as bad as living in 
a makeshift hut on a world that was, 
for the most part, either jungle or 
swamp, and whose inhabitants would 
sooner kill you than look at you. After 
all, what could she do? Architecture 
wasn't exactly the sort of exciting and 
dashing thing that people could rally 
around. She would, in all probability, 
just get herself killed if she tried to 
aid the Rebels. But by doing what she 
knew how to do, she might actually 
save a few lives, or at least make 
those lives more comfortable. Yes, 
those lives would belong to servants 
of the Empire, but after all, not every 
single being here was evil.
 As rationalizations went, that one 
wasn't so bad. Her inner self almost 
bought it.

MEDICAL FRIGATE MEDSTAR FOUR, 
POLAR ORBIT, DESPAYRE
 
 The secretary droid C-4ME-0 stood 
gyroscopically balanced on its single 
wheel in the hallway as Uli exited the 
surgery theater. The procedure had 
been routine, an operation to graft in a 
new liver for a Wookiee slave injured 
in the recent explosion at the 
construction site. Some of the 
enslaved species were considered 
expendable, as there were always 
more potential conscripts on the 
planet below, but Wookiees were too 
valuable to lose, a colonel had told 
him. They were worth three of just 
about any other worker, and Uli had 
already heard it at least ten times 
since he'd gotten here: if you want a 
job done right, get a Wookiee to do it. 
They were able to better withstand the 
temperature extremes of vacuum, they 
had more endurance than the other 
species, and their work ethic was 
unimpeachable?they seemed 
incapable of giving less than 100 
percent, even on a project they had 
been conscripted for. The only 
drawback was that their vacuum suits 
had to be specially made to 
accommodate their huge, hairy forms. 
Uli had wondered why he'd seen so 
many of them when he'd arrived. He'd 
soon realized that like himself, they 
were not here by choice.
 "Dr. Divini," the droid said, in its 
pleasing tenor. "How are you?" "As 
well as can be expected, Fourmio. Is 
there something you need?"
 "I am quite self-sufficient, thank 
you, Doctor. But Commander Hotise 
would like to see you when it is 
convenient."
 Inwardly, Uli groaned. He'd been 
pretty much on the go ever since he'd 
gotten here, and now that his rotation 
was finally over, he'd been looking 
forward to some sleep. "Did he sound 
urgent?"
 "Actually, sir, his precise words 
were, 'Get Divini's butt up here on the 
double.'" The droid did a perfect 
imitation of Hotise's voice.
 Uli had to smile at that. Hotise might 
be a career man, but he was honest 
and direct in his speech and actions. 
And he was just another cog in the 
Empire's giant machine?no point in 
blaming him for the situation.
 Uli was wearing surgical blues, 
which he did not waste time changing. 
While standard service protocols 
ordinarily required more formal dress 
when attending a commanding officer 
in a noncombat area on board a ship, 
the medical units were less stringent. 
Most medics were draftees and didn't 
give a Psadan's patoot what the navy 
thought of them anyhow?they were 
just hoping to get out and go home. 
And like him, any doctor worth his 
laser scalpel knew he, she, or it was 
far too valuable to be stuck in a brig 
for failing to observe some piddling 
uniform code. The Empire was 
sometimes hidebound and slow, but 
not altogether foolish.
 When Uli entered, Hotise was seated 
behind his desk, tapping his fingers 
rapidly on two different input 
consoles. Holoimages danced and 
flashed over the consoles as the codes 
flowed. It was impressive to watch, 
like seeing someone able to write in 
two languages at the same time, one 
with each hand.
 "Sit. Be with you in a few seconds."
 Uli parked himself in the chair, a 
flowform device that hummed and 
adjusted itself to his contours for a 
perfect support. Sitting down was a 
mistake, he belatedly realized. If he 
leaned back, he could fall asleep 
faster than . . . 
 Hotise, true to his word, jarred Uli 
from his doze only a few seconds 
later. "The construction crew has 
gotten a couple of equatorial med 
stations operational?not full-service 
plexes, but they have two surgery 
suites, pre-op and recovery rooms, 
and twenty medical beds each. Not to 
mention bacta tank wards, nursing 
stations, supply rooms, offices . . .  
you know the drill. More than a 
Rimsoo, less than a medcenter."
 "And . . .  ?"
 "And I want you to go run one."
 "I'm not an administrator," Uli said.
 "Teach your grandfather how to put 
his boots on, son. I know you're not 
an administrator, but we're shy a few 
dozen of those right now. 
Construction is running ahead of 
schedule, at least in our field, and 
we're slow getting fresh help.
 '"You're qualified as chief surgeon, 
and I'll send Fourmio along to handle 
the secretarial stuff. We need three 
surgeons and a couple of internal 
medicine docs, all with broad-species 
experience, plus nurses, aides, 
orderlies, and some computer 
operators. It's no worse than running a 
clinic. Caseloads'll be mostly workers 
getting banged up, some infections, 
age-related illnesses?the usual med-
surg stuff on a construction site. 
Nothing you can't handle. If you get 
bogged down, you can call for help."
 There was no way out of this, Uli
