gave them his best grin in return, 
feeling the contentedness that only 
liquor and competitive victory could 
bring. A good job, the respect of 
people you worked with, and a nice-
looking female sitting next to him, in 
a cantina full of excellent Ortolan 
blue ferment. How much better could 
life get?

 PILOTS' PUB, REC DECK, ISD STEEL 
TALON
 
 Vil Dance had a stack of tenth-credit 
coins balanced on his upturned elbow, 
up to a dozen now. Around him, other 
pilots were making bets on whether 
he'd make it.
 So far, so good . . . 
 He took another sip of his ale. The 
game was simple: You pointed your 
elbow like a gun sight and aimed in 
front of you, forearm held at a ninety-
degree angle and parallel to the floor. 
With your open palm next to your ear 
and facing the ceiling, you snapped 
your hand down and tried to catch the 
coins balanced on your elbow before 
they fell. Anybody could do one. 
Most could do three or even four. 
Once you got past ten it was harder. 
Vil's personal best was eighteen, so a 
dozen wasn't that hard. It was a hand-
eye coordination test, and if you were 
a pilot, you'd better have that in a 
goodly amount. The trick was to snap 
your cupped hand down fast enough 
so that you got to the coins while they 
were still stacked together. After a 
few centimeters' free fall in normal 
gravity, they started to break from the 
stack, and once that happened you 
couldn't pull it off. The movement had 
to be fast, but it also had to be 
smooth. The slightest off-angle jerk 
would torque the stack enough to 
separate the coins. You could manage 
most of them if that happened, but 
you'd miss some, guaranteed.
 It wasn't as though the honor of the 
squad or anything was riding on him, 
but Vil did have a reputation to keep 
up. His times on the pilot reaction 
drills were always in the top two or 
three, and that's what this was, 
essentially. A test of reflexes. There 
were other species, like the Falleen, 
for example, who could catch twenty 
or more with no problem whatsoever. 
But few humans could manage even 
ten, other than acrobats, martial arts 
masters . . .  and pilots.
 "C'mon, Dance. You're slower than a 
ronto in eight g's." That was Benjo.
 "Yeah, while we're young," Raal 
added. "Well, some of us, anyway . . . 
"
 Vil grinned, snapped his hand down, 
and grabbed the dozen tenths, no 
problem. "Easy money," he said.
 There was a moment of surprised 
silence among the squad, then:
 "Five says he can't do fourteen."
 "I'll take that bet."
 "Ten says he can."
 "Odds?"
 "Odds? What, do I look like a 
Toydarian bookie? Even!"
 While the pilots argued, Vil 
collected two more coins from a stack 
on the table. Fourteen, eh? Still four 
less than his top number, though he 
didn't see any real point in mentioning 
that right?
 The scramble horn blared, a series of 
short, insistent hoots. The pilots 
dropped the chatter, along with 
whatever else they were holding 
except for their credits, which they 
stuffed into pockets as they ran 
toward the exit. Vil set his mug down 
on the table and followed. There had 
been only one swallow of ale left; it 
would haven taken all of two seconds 
to finish it, but when the horn howled, 
you stopped whatever you were doing 
right that instant and hauled butt for 
your station. First, it was the right 
thing to do; everybody knew that. 
Second, you never knew when an 
Imperial holocam might be watching 
you, and if you got caught dragging 
your feet during a call to station, 
instead of being a crack TIE pilot, you 
might find yourself transferred to a 
few months of "droid duty" scrubbing 
out garbage bins and latrine holding 
tanks.
 And third, Vil liked flying even 
more than he liked drinking.
 "Gotta be a drill," somebody said. 
"Not likely another prison break after 
that last batch we cooked."
 Vil didn't speak to that. Somewhat to 
his surprise, he'd had a couple
 of uncomfortable nights after that 
experience. Yes, they had been 
criminal scum, and it was his job to 
stop said scum, and they had been 
shooting at him, but even so it hadn't 
been a real contest. The Lambda 
hadn't had a chance. He'd blown that 
ship out of vac and watched the 
remnants of the crew whirl through 
the coldness, freezing in clouds of 
their own bodily fluids. One tended to 
think about it as shooting blips, like in 
the holo sims, not people, but seeing 
the carnage that had resulted from his 
weapons had . . .  Well, let's be honest 
here, Vil told himself, since it's all 
just between me. The truth was . . .  
he'd had a few dreams.
 No, not dreams. Dreams were 
innocuous fragments of this and that, 
things like not having studied for a 
test or flying without a craft or being 
naked in public. These hadn't been 
dreams.
 These had been nightmares.
 Thankfully, he'd forgotten the details 
almost immediately after waking up, 
save for one night. That had stayed 
with him. One of the flash-frozen 
corpses, drifting through the void 
about ten meters away from the 
cockpit of his fighter. Its head and 
body had been ravaged by shrapnel to 
such an extent that Vil couldn't tell if 
it had been male or female. He'd 
watched, fascinated, as the lacerated 
body rotated slowly, bringing its face 
into view. He'd noticed that, by some 
miracle of chance, the eyes had been 
untouched by the sleetstorm of metal . 
. . 
 And then the eyes opened.
 Vil suppressed a shudder. That had 
been the worst. He told himself that it 
wasn't unusual, that it was part of the 
job. That he'd get used to it.
 It helped. A little.
 As Vil approached the hangar, he 
saw the assistant to the command 
officer on deck waving the pilots in.
 "Move like you've got a purpose, 
people! A pregnant Pa'lowick could 
run faster! Let's go!"
 "ADO," Vil said as he approached. 
"What's flyin'?"
 "You and your squad, among nine 
others," the ADO said. He kept 
waving at the still-approaching pilots, 
down now to only a handful. "VIP 
escort for the Imperial-class 
Destroyer Devastator."
 Vil blinked. "We got a rainbow-
jacket admiral? A Moff?"
 "Not exactly. The guy running this 
ship is more of a monotone," said the 
ADO. Noting Vil's blank look, he 
added, "All black."
 Vil got it then. "Darth Vader."
 "Friend of yours?"
 Vil laughed. They were side by side 
on the stairs, almost to the flight deck. 
Vil said, "Never met the man?or 
whatever he is. Saw him fly once. TIE 
school, out of Imperial City Naval 
Base. Against Barvel."
 There was no need to specify that he 
was talking about Colonel Vindoo 
"The Shooter" Barvel, one of the most 
decorated TIE pilots ever. During the 
Clone Wars, Barvel had taken out 
more than thirty confirmed enemy 
craft in ship-to-ship combat, twice 
that many more probables, and 
nobody knew how many he hadn't 
even bothered to report. Vil knew he 
himself was a good pilot, a hot-hand 
even in training, but Barvel, who had 
been cycled out of combat by jittery 
brass to make sure the Empire had a 
live hero to parade around as a 
recruiter, was the best. Even though 
he was only a captain at the time, he'd 
been put in charge of the pilot school 
at ICNB. Barvel could power-dive the 
wings off any other craft and hit a 
target the size of a pleeky on the way 
down at top speed, port or starboard 
cannon, you pick which gun. In 
training missions he'd flown with the 
man, Vil had felt like a small child 
who could barely walk trying to keep 
up with a champion distance runner.
 During maneuvers for the about-to-
graduate pilots, Darth Vader had 
shown up. He didn't have any military 
rank per se, but he was the Emperor's 
wrist-hawk and everybody knew it. If 
it came from Vader's augmented 
voxbox, it might as well have come 
from Palpatine's lips, and you argued 
with it at your peril, no matter how 
high your rank.
 Vader had watched for a time, then 
asked for a TIE fighter. He had 
climbed in, taken off, and joined the 
mock battle. Within seconds, his 
electronic guns had painted half a 
dozen ships, and it had come down to 
Vader versus Barvel. Vil, whose ship 
had been hit in a three-on-one early in 
the pretend fight, had been in a 
holding pattern waiting for the 
engagement to finish, and he'd 
watched it all.
 Vader hadn't exactly flown circles 
around Barvel, but every time The 
Shooter jigged or jinked, Vader was 
half a second ahead of him. Barvel 
was doing things Vil didn't think were 
possible in a TIE, and Vader not only 
matched him, move for move, he just 
plain outflew him. It was? no other 
word for it?astounding. Vil quickly 
realized that Vader could have taken 
the flight school commander out at 
any time?he was only playing with 
him.
 That had been as spooky in its own 
way as Vil's nightmare. He'd never 
seen a human pilot move like that. 
Damned few alien ones either, for that 
matter.
 After a few passes, and with what 
had seemed a slow, offhand, lazy 
series of rolls and loops, Vader came 
around, nailed Barvel with his 
training beams, and it was "Game 
over." All the pilots hanging there in 
space had to reach up and shut their 
mouths manually.
 The ADO looked down the hallway, 
but no more pilots were inbound. He 
turned and pointed. "Better get to 
your ship, Dance." A short pause, 
then: "Vader's good, huh?"
 "Better than good. If it was him 
against me, I'd just overload my 
engine and blow myself up?that way 
I'd get to pick my own moment to 
die."
 What Vil hadn't mentioned, mostly 
because he still didn't believe it 
himself, was that the mechanic who'd 
serviced Vader's borrowed TIE fighter 
afterward had come out of the bay 
shaking his head. The nav and 
targeting comps had been turned off, 
he'd said. Cockpit recorder showed 
that Vader had done that before he'd 
left the dock. So if the mechanic was 
to be believed, not only had Vader 
beaten the best pilot in the navy as 
easily as if Barvel had been a crop 
duster on some backrocket world, he 
had done so on manual.
 Which was simply impossible.
 "Go," the ADO said. "Hit vac?you 
don't want to be late to the party."
 "No, sir." Not that Vader needs the 
escort, Vil thought. Nobody here 
could get in his way.
 Vil hurried onto the deck, his 
mechanic waving him to his TIE. 
"Been takin' a nap, rocketjock? Get 
in!"
 As Vil clamped down his helmet and 
checked his readings, he had a 
moment to ponder the purpose of the 
escort. Darth Vader, commanding a 
big Destroyer. Wonder what he's 
doing here?
 Had to be something big. You could 
have a headful of hard vac and still 
suss that out.
 The air lock doors opened. Vil lit his 
engines and was gone.

 RECEIVING DECK SEVEN, HAVELON
 
 Tarkin frowned as he waited on the 
receiving deck for Vader to arrive.
 It was certainly true that the 
Emperor could send whomever he 
liked, whenever he liked, to check on 
the station's progress. Tarkin had no 
reason to be anything but grateful to 
the Emperor?how many Grand 
Moffs were there, after all? Who had 
elevated him to that puissant position 
and given him command of the most 
important military project in galactic 
history?
 All that was true. And he was 
grateful?to Palpatine. But one feels 
differently toward the one holding the 
leash than toward the one on the 
leash.
 There was something about Vader 
that set his teeth on edge. It wasn't just 
the prosthetic suit with its mask and 
breather, nor the fact that he couldn't 
see the eyes behind those polarized 
lenses. Vader had power, both 
personal and as the Emperor's tool, 
and Tarkin's sense of him was that he 
cared about as much for a human life 
standing next to him as he did about a 
mistfly in the far-off swamps of 
Neimoidia. Standing next to Vader 
was like standing next to a giant 
thermal grenade?it might just go off 
at any moment.
 And the man in black had a temper, 
no doubt about that. Thus far, he had 
not unleashed it in Tarkin's direction, 
but Tarkin had seen it loosed on 
others, and those who thought to give 
Vader grief quickly realized that it 
was a fatal mistake. No matter how 
much people decried the Force as 
being a superstition that hadn't saved 
the Jedi from annihilation, it was real 
enough to enable Vader to stop a 
man's heart or keep the breath from 
his lungs simply by willing it. Not to 
mention knocking blaster bolts from 
the air with that lightsaber of his. 
True, nothing would be able to 
withstand the force of this battle 
station's armament, once it was 
operational. But it wouldn't be fully 
operational for another few months, 
and anybody who was both strong 
enough and foolish enough to slay 
Vader would have to deal with the 
Emperor's wrath?and he made Vader 
seem like an Iridonian hugglepup.
 The shuttle hatch opened. With most 
military VIPs, there would be an 
honor guard of elite stormtroopers or 
even Imperial Red Guards emerging 
first. Not so with Vader. He strode 
through the hatch and down the ramp 
alone, his cape billowing behind him 
in the wind of his own passage, 
fearless, not the least bit worried 
about any possible danger. He was 
arrogant, but then he had reason to be.
 Tarkin waited, his admirals shifting 
nervously behind him. Some of them 
couldn't stand the very idea of a man 
like Vader, who existed outside the 
chain of command and was able to 
come and go as he pleased, not truly 
subject to military orders. Well, it was 
what it was, and there was no help for 
it.
 Vader approached to stand before 
Tarkin. He always seemed larger and 
taller than Tarkin remembered, a dark 
presence, a force, as it were, of nature. 
"Grand Moff Tarkin," he said, 
offering not even the slightest nod of 
a military bow. Vader bent the knee to 
no one, save the Emperor, Tarkin 
knew.
 "Lord Vader." There was no point in 
offering small talk or pleasantries; 
Vader had no use for them. "Shall we 
begin the tour?" Tarkin asked, 
extending one hand in a gesture that 
encompassed the entirety of the 
station.
 "Proceed."
 "This way. We'll take my lighter."
 
 
 
 Vader could sense the hostility of 
some of the men behind Tarkin, but 
that was of no importance. Hostile 
words or actions he could and would 
deal with, but thoughts of the weak-
minded were no threat.
 Tarkin, oily and smooth as always, 
was a man who knew where his best 
interests lay, and as long as his own 
plans matched those of the Emperor, 
he was a useful tool. Which was good, 
because Vader would not hesitate to 
use that tool.
 The Rebels were turning out to be 
more troublesome than many had 
expected. The Emperor had known it 
would be thus, of course; the 
resistance had not been a surprise to 
him. The Emperor was completely in 
concert with the dark side of the 
Force. He was the most powerful Sith 
who had ever existed.
 As would Vader be, someday.
 But that was in the future. Now he 
had more mundane duties. There were 
problems with the construction of this 
station. When Vader left, those 
problems would be corrected. He 
would return as necessary to correct 
more troubles as they appeared, and 
he would also return at times when 
things were proceeding smoothly, just 
to remind Tarkin and his senior 
officers that the Emperor's eye was 
always watching them.
 Always.

LOWER LEVEL TROOP BARRACKS, 
SECTOR N-ONE, DEATH STAR
 
 The N-One sector, a huge area equal 
to one twenty-fourth of a hemisphere, 
had been partly pressurized and 
heated, so at least Teela didn't have to 
wear a vac suit to work anymore. 
Thank the stars for that; she was sick 
to death of ending each day fatigued 
by the effort of manipulating the stiff 
joints and servos, the limited vision, 
and the inability to scratch?to name 
only a few problems. She'd worn vac 
suits before on jobs, and those 
experiences hadn't been pleasant, but 
this was by far the worst, because the 
Empire, no doubt in a cost-saving 
effort, had mandated the use of 
outmoded constant-volume suits 
instead of the newer, elastic one-piece 
designs.
 The suits had been necessary for a 
time, however. On a project this size 
there was no way to complete the 
entire hull, pressurize it all, and then 
start building the interior?the 
amount of air necessary would be 
tremendous. Once the vessel was 
functional, then the multitude of 
converters installed in every sector 
could easily handle the task, but until 
those were online, air would have to 
be sucked from a planetary 
atmosphere and hauled up out of the 
gravity well by cargo ship?either 
that, or build a huge conversion plant 
in space and truck water to that, 
which would be even harder. A tanker 
full of water was more unwieldy than 
one full of air bottles, and without 
proper heat it just turned into blocks 
of ice when you unloaded it, which in 
turn resulted in problems with 
increased volume. The sheer 
magnitude of the project wouldn't 
allow a full exterior hull construction 
first.
 Thus it had been reasoned early on 
that, while the hull was being laid, 
individual sectors would be built and 
sealed. This allowed plenty of storage 
space, at least at first, for supplies, as 
well as habitats for workers to stay 
close to the task. Hundreds of 
thousands of laborers needed 
someplace convenient to live?
shuttling them back and forth for any 
distance after every shift was neither 
cost- nor time-effective.
 The hull-plate extruders were only a 
few hundred kilometers away, hung at 
a fixed orbital point where the 
gravitational forces of the prison 
planet and the raw-material asteroids 
being towed to the gigantic 
masticators all balanced. The process 
was simple enough. An asteroid 
sufficiently high in nickel-iron 
content was hauled from the outlying 
belt to the masticators and fed into a 
maw; the whirling durasteel teeth 
chewed the asteroid to tiny bits and 
mixed them with alloy ores mined and 
brought up from Despayre, including 
quadanium. The resulting gravel had 
water added and was put under high 
pressure to form a slurry, then fed into 
pipelines that led to the smelters. 
These were essentially huge melting 
pots that refined the mix, burning off 
impurities. The resulting scarified ore 
was conveyed to extruders that 
pressed out the hull plate, rather like 
food paste from a squeezed tube. 
There was still a lot of slag left over, 
but this was just gathered together, 
pointed at the local star, and given a 
hard push. Months later, these slag-
rafts would fall into the sun and be 
burned up.
 Teela had been on projects before 
that used deep-space masticators and 
extruders, of course, such as skyhooks 
and wheelworlds. She'd never seen as 
large or as many as there were here, 
however. The amount of plate being 
produced was beyond any amount 
ever used in one place before.
 Sector N-One was shaped like a 
large crescent slice of juicemelon, cut 
in half midway. It was thirty-one 
kilometers wide at the base, which 
would be the equator when the station 
was finished, narrowing almost to a 
point only a few dozen meters wide at 
the other end, and just over ninety-
four klicks long. Most of the sectors 
would be identical in this hemisphere, 
save for a select few and including, of 
course, those through which the 
superlaser would be constructed.
 It was hard to visualize the scope of 
the whole orb. Big didn't begin to do 
it justice. The habitable crust alone 
was two kilometers thick, and 
included in it the surface city sprawls, 
armory, hangar bays, command 
center, technical areas, and living 
quarters. Below that would be the 
hyperdrive, reactor core, and 
secondary power sources?none of 
which, fortunately, concerned her.
 What concerned her at the moment 
was an old and somewhat cranky 
Wookiee who was giving her a hard 
time.
 Teela's command of the Wookiee 
language was rudimentary. The 
problem with speaking Shyriiwook 
wasn't so much the vocabulary as the 
pronunciation; a human's vocal 
apparatus just couldn't handle the 
grunts, groans, and howls necessary to 
be understood. Like most people 
who'd ever been around serious 
construction projects, Teela was used 
to dealing with the tall and furry 
bipeds?they seemed to gravitate to 
such sites, even when they weren't 
being enslaved and forced to labor on 
them. Fortunately, on the big projects 
most Wookiees understood Basic, 
even if they couldn't wrap their 
tongues around it any more than 
humans could deal with Wookiee-
speak. Given all that, Teela usually 
managed to communicate well 
enough with them.
 Usually.
 The chief on this shift in this 
subsector was a grizzled old Wook 
named Hahrynyar, who probably 
would have joined up voluntarily if he 
hadn't been grabbed and enslaved. His 
coat was gray from muzzle to ankle, 
he was stubborn and intractable, and 
he had the annoying habit of 
forgetting how to understand Basic 
whenever Teela made an indisputable 
point. Which was what was 
happening now.
 "Haaarm," the Wookiee said. "Aarn 
whynn roowarrn."
 "I understand that it's on the plans. 
What I'm saying is I don't want you to 
build it. It doesn't make any sense to 
put a heat exhaust port there. The 
main exhaust port is already done, and 
if there is a need for additional ones?
which I don't believe there is, at all?
there are better places to put them 
than right next to the main one. We 
don't need it in this sector, and 
certainly not there." She pointed at 
the holo schematic of the polar trench.
 "Harnkk whoom?"
 "On my authority, that's whose."
 "Arrk-arn ksh sawrron."
 Teela chuckled. She'd understood 
that well enough. "Yes, yes, I'll put it 
in writing."
 These old metal benders and rivet 
pounders always thought they knew 
better than the architect when it came 
down to the actual construction. 
Sometimes they did, which was fine. 
But no matter what, they'd stick to the 
approved plan like a preprogrammed 
droid with permabond on its wheels to 
make sure they didn't get scalded by 
the sector work boss.
 She couldn't blame the Wook for 
wanting it in writing. Early in her 
career Teela had taken verbal orders 
from a designer. No big deal, just 
some interior frame spec on a resiplex 
he thought was silly, so he'd told her 
to use a different grade of durasteel 
and, when she'd seemed uncertain, 
had assured her it was plenty strong 
enough to handle the job and a lot 
cheaper, so what was the problem? 
She'd shrugged and done what he'd 
asked. When the inspectors came 
around and refused to approve the 
building, the designer had been very 
quick to point out that his assistant 
must have made that decision all on 
her own, because the plans? and 
he?had specifically called for 9095-
T8511 grade on that scaffold frame, 
and if his assistant had used 9093-
T7511? Well, it didn't matter that the 
alloy and heat-treat could easily take 
the load if the plans called for the 
higher grade, now, did it?
 He had hung her out to twist in the 
breeze. Later, when Teela had 
stormed into the designer's office to 
give him a piece of her mind, he had 
laughed at her. She needed to learn 
how to play in the real galaxy, he'd 
told her. If you got caught, you passed 
the blame along. What she should 
have done, he'd said, was laid it onto 
the obviously blind and stupid 
construction crew chief who had 
selected the wrong alloy. He could 
read a plan, couldn't he?
 Teela couldn't prove anything and 
she wasn't stupid. After that, she made 
certain to get any deviations from the 
plans appended to the work order in 
writing. So she knew exactly what the 
old Wookiee was thinking.
 "Don't worry about it now," she said. 
"You have to get the heat exchangers 
into the barracks before you'd start on 
piddly stuff like ports, anyhow."
 "Arrrrnn rowwlnnn." Well, yes, 
Hahrynyar allowed, that was the way 
a smart builder would do things.
 "Go, then. Somebody has mislaid 
my shipment of triaxial fiber-optic 
cable and I've got to run it down. Get 
the exchangers unpacked and a crew 
started installing them, and we'll get 
back to the philosophy of exhaust 
ports later, okay?"
 The old Wookiee nodded and headed 
off. Teela watched him lumber away 
for a second, then turned her attention 
to the next problem. Never a dull 
moment, the day was never long 
enough, and they sure didn't pay her 
enough . . . 
 She had to smile at that. The pay 
might not be much, but it was better 
than living in a pesthole down on a 
planet full of murdering scum. Even 
cantankerous old Hahrynyar couldn't 
argue with that.
 
 
 
 GUNNERY COMMAND, ISD STEEL 
TALON
 
 Tenn Graneet stuck his head into the 
CO's office. "You wanted to see me, 
Cap?"
 His commanding officer looked up 
from his flimsiwork. "Come in, 
Tenn."
 Tenn ducked slightly to pass through 
the hatch. Captain Hoberd's office 
looked, as usual, like the local A-grav 
had somehow suffered a massive flux 
in just this room; datachips were piled 
haphazardly on the floor, the two 
holopics on opposite walls?one was 
an image of Hoberd's graduating 
class, the other of his wife, Linesee, 
and their two kids; Tenn could never 
remember their names. The holos 
hung constantly askew, and Hoberd's 
Silver Valor medal was dangling from 
the upper hinge of a wall cabinet. 
Every time Tenn entered the CO's 
office, the medal was dangling from a 
different location?on one or the 
other of the family pics, from the 
small alumabronze sculpture on his 
desk, even swinging slightly in the 
breeze directly beneath the air vent . . 
.  he couldn't recall ever seeing it in 
the same place twice. Droot and some 
of the others reported the same 
experience. No one ever saw him 
move it, and no one knew why he did. 
It was just a quirk of the captain's. 
Those unfamiliar with his war record 
might think he had a disrespectful 
attitude, but nothing could be further 
from the truth?at least, not in Tenn's 
opinion.
 "What's up?" He couldn't read 
anything from the man's face, which 
wasn't unusual; Hoberd, it was said, 
could outstare a Weequay. Normally 
this didn't bother Tenn, but today, for 
some reason, he began to feel a little 
uneasy. The energy in the room was 
subtly different. He didn't go in for 
woo-woo concepts like that, but 
sometimes he couldn't deny it.
 "Sit down, Tenn." Hoberd's 
expression didn't change. Tenn looked 
at the chairs, both of which were 
filled with various objects, and 
perched on the edge of the less 
cluttered one. "I've got some bad 
news, I'm afraid."
 Uh-oh, Tenn thought. Had to have 
been that last inspection; he couldn't 
think of any other possibility. What 
had gone wrong? An improper 
calibration? Not up to spit-'n'-polish 
standards? What was it?
 The CO let him sweat for a moment, 
then grinned. "Bad news for me, 
anyway?I'm losing my best 
noncom."
 "Sir?"
 "Pack your bags, Chief. You're for 
the Death Star. They're giving you the 
big gun."
 At first the words didn't make sense 
to Tenn. Then the meaning broke 
through, like a sun through clouds, 
and he grinned.
 "No poodoo, Cap?"
 Hoberd held up a small datachip. 
"Orders just came down." He tossed 
the chip, and Tenn caught it in midair. 
He was aware that he was grinning 
like a kid. "Thanks, Cap!"
 Hoberd frowned slightly. "You sure 
you want to do this?"
