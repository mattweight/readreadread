Jedi simply . . . disappeared, leaving 
nothing behind but his robes and 
cloak.
 Tarkin stared at the image, his jaw 
dropping in disbelief. This was 
impossible?there had to be some 
trick at work. Nobody could survive 
decapitation by a lightsaber!
 "Lord Vader is on his way in," came 
a voice from the intercom.
 Tarkin nodded. He switched off the 
recording and changed to an external 
view of the starfield, which he stood 
regarding. After a moment, Vader 
entered the room and came to stand 
next to him.
 "Are they away?" Tarkin asked.
 "They have just made the jump into 
hyperspace."
 "You're sure the homing beacon is 
secure aboard their ship? I'm taking 
an awful risk, Vader. This had better 
work."
 It was indeed a risk, letting the 
Princess and her band of rogues 
"escape." If it didn't work, they would 
not only lose a high-level prisoner and 
a couple of Rebel spies?they would 
lose the Death Star plans as well. And 
even though Tarkin tended to agree 
with Motti that having the plans 
wouldn't really do the Alliance any 
good now that the battle station was 
operational, he wasn't interested in 
taking any risks with the ultimate 
weapon. But if the escapees fled to 
the main Rebel fortress, as Vader was 
certain they would, the war would be 
over sooner than expected.
 Much sooner.
 The plans, after all, would hardly 
survive the destruction of whatever 
planet they came to rest upon.
 The Death Star was at last 
operational, and there was no place in 
the galaxy where a beat-up Corellian 
freighter could run that they could not 
follow.



LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES, DEATH STAR
 
 Making good on his promise that he 
could retrieve classified information 
and use it was proving to be 
somewhat harder than Atour Riten 
had anticipated. While he had certain 
codes that would allow him to access 
restricted files, the nuts-and-bolts 
operation of a vessel as large as this 
one was not a simple matter. There 
were so many subsystems, so many 
backups and redundant programs, that 
winnowing out the precise details was 
time consuming in the extreme. Were 
it not for P-RC3, he would never have 
been able to manage it.
 "What do we have so far?" he asked 
the droid. "And please skip the part 
where you warn me how dangerous it 
is."
 P-RC3 said, "I have accessed the 
shuttle-craft codes. The vessel most 
likely to be of use is the E-Two-Tee 
Medical Shuttle, a small, fast 
ambulance craft. It is unarmed and 
clearly marked as a noncombat 
medical transport, and under normal 
circumstances neither the Rebel 
Alliance nor the Empire will fire on it. 
It also has limited hyperdrive 
capability. It generally carries a crew 
of six, with facilities to transport and 
maintain twice that many human-
sized patients."
 "Good, good, that gives us plenty of 
room. What about the tractor beam?"
 "Recent misuse of tractor beam 
controls has resulted in increased 
security. However, surreptitious 
programming using an ouroboros 
routine will, with a proper activation 
signal, result in a temporary overload 
to the beam projector's circuit breaker 
in the sector from which the ship 
would, in theory, be departing. This 
will keep that particular projector 
offline for approximately thirty 
seconds before the automatic reset. A 
return to full power will require 
fifteen seconds more. A pilot of 
sufficient skill should be able to 
accelerate far enough during that time 
to be out of range; however, if he 
ventures into the path of any of the 
other sectors' beams, they could 
capture the ship."
 "Excellent."
 "I have not, however, been able to 
bypass bay door controls for egress. 
Those systems are not yet linked to 
the main computer."
 "That's no good," Atour said. "If we 
can't get the shuttle launched, the rest 
doesn't matter."
 "So it would seem."
 Atour considered the problem. 
"What is the procedure for standard 
emergency medical transport launch?"
 "The onboard crew sends a copy of 
its orders to Bay Door Control and 
requests permission to depart. The 
flight plan is checked via corn-link to 
Flight Control and, if valid, the officer 
in charge gives the order to his 
technicians. A force field sufficient to 
retain atmosphere but permeable 
enough to allow vessels to penetrate is 
produced. The vessel exits, the doors 
are closed and sealed, the field is shut 
off."
 Atour nodded. "So the only 
reasonable solution here is to have the 
doors opened by the BDC crew."
 "Yes."
 "Hmm. Can you produce a bogus 
flight plan and order for 
transmission?"
 "I can, but I cannot insert that plan 
into the Flight Control systems,
 which are independent of the main 
computer. They will have no record of 
them."
 "But you can jam or redirect 
communications if you have the op-
chan frequencies?"
 "Certainly, sir. Even you could do 
that."
 Atour gave him a look. "So if the 
door crew sends a signal to the Flight 
Control crew and instead of getting to 
them it goes somewhere else, then 
whoever gets that call could verify the 
orders?"
 "In theory," the droid said.
 "Well, then that problem is solved. 
You'll just have it set up so that that 
call comes here."
 The droid turned to regard him.
 "Oh, don't look at me like that?I 
won't be here. You will take the call 
and verify it."
 "That would be illegal, sir. I cannot 
knowingly violate Imperial law."
 "But if I am on that shuttle and you 
don't confirm the order, then I'll be 
arrested, and possibly even executed."
 "In that case, my primary 
programming, which is to protect you 
from harm, would allow such illegal 
activity."
 Atour slapped P-RC3 on the back. 
"Good man. I knew I could count on 
you."
 "Yes, sir."
 "Set it up, Persee. I have a feeling 
we won't have a lot of time. Once this 
station comes out of hyperspace, 
things will get very active around 
here."
 "Right away, sir."
 "I'm going to pay a visit to the local 
cantina now. Let me know when you 
get everything done."



CONFERENCE ROOM, COMMAND 
CENTER, DEATH STAR
 
 Vader was still attempting to come 
to terms with the disappearance of 
Obi-Wan. His moment of triumph as 
he'd cut the old man down had been 
short-lived. How ironic that he'd been 
constantly telling non-believers like 
Tarkin not to underestimate the power 
of the Force, and now he'd witnessed 
an event that made him realize he was 
guilty of just such heresy himself.
 His Master had never spoken of Jedi 
just vanishing into nothingness. This 
bespoke a power that Vader had not 
yet seen, even in the dark side. But 
surely it must exist there. Perhaps it 
had something to do with the 
darksome hints that his Master had 
dropped, from time to time, about 
Darth Plagueis, the Sith Lord who had 
been Darth Sidious's Master. Plagueis 
had been, according to the Emperor, 
obsessed with the preservation of the 
immaterial ego after the physical 
death of the body. Vader determined 
to ask his Master about it as soon as 
this distracting foolishness with the 
Rebels was?
 The intercom beeped. Tarkin 
answered it. "Yes?"
 "We are approaching the planet 
Yavin," a tech said. "The Rebel base 
is on a moon on the far side. We are 
preparing to orbit the planet."
 Tarkin smiled as he disconnected 
and looked at Vader. "Well, Lord 
Vader, it seems you were correct. We 
are almost in position to break the 
back of the Alliance. I am sure the 
Emperor will be pleased."
 "If the station performs as it is 
supposed to," Vader said. He believed 
that it would, but Tarkin seemed a bit 
too smug and sure of himself. It 
served him to keep the man slightly 
on the defensive.
 "Oh, it will," Tarkin said. "I 
guarantee it will."

THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Memah had closed the cantina again, 
this time ostensibly to repair a 
malfunctioning cooler unit.
 Ratua came back to the bar, waving 
a small electronic device. "Sniffer 
says we're still clean. No listening 
devices have been brought in since we 
got here."
 "That's good," Rodo said, "because 
if we weren't involved in a conspiracy 
that would get us all shot before, we 
sure are now."
 Memah looked around at the others: 
Riten, the instigator; Dance, the TIE 
pilot; Kaarz, the architect; Stihl, the 
guard; Divini, the doctor; Rodo, 
Ratua, and herself. Eight of them, 
against the might of the Empire. Not 
very good odds, Memah thought. One 
misstep and they were all dead.
 "Any questions?" Riten asked.
 "It seems too easy," Rodo said.
 "Not really," Nova said. "The station 
is designed to withstand massive 
attack from without, but nobody 
worries too much about security 
within. The place is full of 
stormtroopers, guards, army and navy 
personnel, even a few bounty hunters 
thrown in. Plus, the only ways in or 
out are well protected. And if you do 
manage to get out, there are enough 
guns to turn you into subatomic 
particles, and twenty-four tractor 
beam batteries to hold you still while 
they do it."
 There was a small jolt. Everyone 
reacted uneasily. "What now?" Uli 
asked.
 "Just came out of hyperspace," Vil 
observed. "Wherever we were going, 
we're probably there."
 "The Yavin system," Riten said. 
"Three planets, the only one of which 
concerns us being Yavin Prime. A gas 
giant with a number of habitable 
moons."
 "And why is this important?" Ratua 
asked.
 "Remember the Rebel freighter that 
'escaped'? The one with the doc's 
girlfriend on it?" Nova asked.
 Uli shook his head. "Not my 
girlfriend, alas. Although she made 
Atour's point about not being part of 
the problem well enough to convince 
me to join this raggedy crew."
 "Yeah, well, the scut in the guard 
shack is that the ship was bugged and 
let go so we could follow it. Tarkin 
thinks there's a Rebel base here 
somewhere."
 "Bad for them if it's so," Rodo said.
 "But perhaps not for us," Riten said. 
"If the navy is busy fighting off Rebel 
attack ships, it might make it easier 
for us to escape."
 Nova said, "Nothing the Rebels have 
can get close enough to scratch the 
finish on the Death Star?anything 
bigger than a flghter'll get blown apart 
a thousand klicks out."
 "Still, during a battle, ambulance 
ships sometimes get dispatched 
without causing undue concern."
 Rodo shook his head. "I hope you 
and your droid got all this right," he 
said to the archivist. "Otherwise even 
an ambulance won't do us much 
good."
 Teela said, "So what do we do 
now?"
 "Go on back to your routine, keep 
your heads down, and don't cause any 
fuss. Set your personal comlink to the 
library's data channel?that's five-
five-seven-point-nine. As soon as 
everything is in place, I'll call, and 
with any luck, that call will be very 
soon.
 "You'll have thirty minutes to make 
it to the transport. If everything goes 
well, we'll be in deep space a couple 
of minutes after that?and free."
 "If everything goes well," Vil said. 
His voice was dry.



LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES, DEATH STAR
 
 Two black-clad security guards were 
waiting, flanking P-RC3, when Atour 
arrived.
 Atour felt his insides freeze. "What's 
going on here?"
 "Is this droid assigned to you, sir?"
 Stay calm. "Yes."
 "Apparently it is malfunctioning, 
Commander. Our computer security 
monitor detected it attempting to 
access restricted data."
 "This must be a mistake. This droid 
has been performing in an exemplary 
manner. I couldn't be happier with?"
 "That may be, sir, but our orders are 
to take the droid into custody and 
arrange for a memory scan."
 Oh, dear. I'm sorry, Persee.
 He tried, knowing that it was 
fruitless. "That may disrupt its ability 
to function. And it is a most valuable 
assistant."
 "I'm sorry, sir, but we have our 
orders," the guard said. "Come 
along," he added to the droid.
 P-RC3 said, "I'm sure it's a simple 
mistake, Commander Riten, and a 
scan will straighten it all out. Oh, by 
the way, I did finish those filing 
chores you asked me to do. I hope 
they will be of assistance to you."
 "Good luck, Persee."
 "And to you, sir."
 The guards led the droid away.
 Atour sighed in regret. Pretty soon 
P-RC3 was going to have a mental 
meltdown. Atour felt bad about it. 
Yes, the droid could be repro-
grammed, but it wouldn't be the same. 
Sad. He had liked P-RC3, more than 
he did most people.
 But there was a bigger problem to 
consider. If P-RC3 wasn't here to take 
the call to verify the medical 
transport's right to leave the station, it 
wouldn't be going anywhere. And P-
RC3 was gone.
 It seemed that somebody else would 
have to be here to take that call.



SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Ready to crank it up, Chief?" Tenn 
Graneet looked steadily at his CO. 
"Absolutely, sir," he said.
 It was a lie, of course. He was not 
ready. Not after Alderaan. The 
destruction of the prison planet had 
been gut wrenching enough, even 
though he'd known the place had been 
home to killers and spice dealers and 
other scum of the galaxy. He 
reminded himself of that often, trying 
to find comfort in it, trying not to 
think about the thousands of guards 
and other personnel stationed on 
Despayre, some of whom had been 
his friends, not to mention the 
considerable number who had been 
wrongfully convicted and exiled 
there, all of whom had also died in 
fire because he had thrown the lever. 
Try as he might, he couldn't justify 
their massacre simply as collateral 
damage.
 And even if he could, there was still 
Alderaan. That hadn't been collateral 
damage. That had been genocide on a 
planetary scale, an entire world wiped 
away, and for what? Why did all 
those millions of people have to die?
 As an object lesson. To show the 
galaxy that the Empire meant 
business, that Palpatine was not to be 
trifled with. To make sure that 
Tarkin's fear doctrine was taken 
seriously.
 And to punish?no, to torture?a 
young noblewoman who was part of 
the Rebellion.
 He'd heard the story from more than 
one source. There had been no Rebel 
force hidden on Alderaan?if he 
could have believed there had been, it 
might have helped. But there had been 
guards there when Tarkin had told 
Motti to drop the hammer. They had 
heard the truth.
 And it had been Tenn who'd pulled 
the trigger. He had sent the beam that 
killed at least a billion people, maybe 
more; he didn't know what the 
planetary population had been. No 
doubt there was an up-to-date census 
in some datafile somewhere, but he 
wasn't going looking for it. He didn't 
want to know the figures. The bottom 
line was that he had done it.
 That knowledge was worse than gut 
wrenching. Much worse. Tenn hadn't 
had a peaceful night's sleep since he'd 
done it, and he didn't see how he ever 
could again.
 "Scut is we're on the trail of the 
Rebels," his CO said. "Just wanted to 
give you a head's-up. Stay frosty." He 
turned and descended the steep 
stairs?almost a ladder?back down 
to the deck, leaving Tenn alone in the 
control room.
 Alone, he thought. If only. Tenn 
knew he would never be alone again.
 Yes, he was a good soldier, a cog in 
the well-oiled machine that was the 
Empire. He followed orders. He did 
his job. But how could a man live 
with the knowledge that he, 
personally, had dropped the curtain on 
more people at once than anybody 
had ever done before?
 How could he live with all those 
ghosts?
 He, Master Chief Petty Officer Tenn 
Graneet, was the biggest mass 
murderer in galactic history. That was 
something to tell those hypothetical 
great-grandkids about, wasn't it?
 And now he was about to add still 
more to the total. Hey, why not? What 
was a few hundred thousand, or even 
a million more, when you had already 
scragged the populations of two 
planets?
 He didn't know if he could do it 
again. When the moment came to 
destroy the Rebel base, he wasn't sure 
he could.
 He knew he didn't want to?of that 
he was certain.
 But if he didn't, somebody else 
would, and he'd get tossed into 
detention for disobeying an order. 
Then he'd have plenty of time on his 
hands to think about that moment 
when he had put every vile dictator or 
madman who had ever committed 
genocide to shame. General Grievous, 
the Butcher of Montellian Serat, 
Grand Admiral Ishin Il-Raz . . . 
pikers, all of them. None of them had 
ever slain so many, so suddenly.
 So easily . . .
 There was an old proverb his 
grandfather had taught him when he'd 
been a boy: Take care what you wish 
for, Tenn?you might get it.
 Now he understood exactly what that 
meant. He had wanted to fire the big 
gun, and he had gotten to do just that. 
The only man in the galaxy who had 
shot it for real, at real targets, and 
look what it had bought him:
 Misery beyond his ugliest dreams.
 Graneet, the planet killer. Two up, 
two down.
 People were already looking at him 
funny. Someday this war would be 
over, and what he had done couldn't 
be kept a secret. Alderaan had been 
destroyed, and somebody had done it. 
The citizens of the Empire? or 
maybe even the Republic once again, 
though he didn't see how the Alliance 
stood a chance, now?they'd want to 
pore over the details of the action. 
And once they did, they'd find him. 
They'd hold him up to the light and 
decry his hideous aspect.
 Graneet, the planet killer. Unique 
among men. Got a pest problem? Call 
the chief?guaranteed to get rid of 
'em all.
 He wouldn't be able to walk on a 
street on any civilized planet in the 
galaxy; people wouldn't be able to 
abide his presence.
 Nor would he blame them.
 He couldn't stop thinking about it. 
He didn't believe he would ever be 
able to stop thinking about it. The 
dead would haunt him, forever.
 How could a man live with that?

COMMAND CENTER, DEATH STAR
 
 Vader and Tarkin watched the 
schematic representation of Yavin 
Prime glowing in the air. The smaller 
image of the moon Yavin 4 behind the 
translucent gas giant moved in small 
increments toward the outer 
perimeter.
 The voice from the comm said, 
"Orbiting the planet at maximum 
velocity. The moon with the Rebel 
base will be in range in thirty 
minutes."
 The countdown flashed on the 
screen.
 Vader had thought long and hard 
about his duel with Obi-Wan, and had 
come to a somewhat satisfying 
conclusion: whatever had happened to 
his body, his old teacher was no more. 
That was what mattered. Wherever 
his form had gone, whatever it had 
become, he would not be seen in this 
galaxy again. That was more 
important than anything else.
 To Tarkin, he said, "This will be a 
day long remembered. It has seen the 
end of Kenobi. It will soon see the 
end of the Rebellion."
 Tarkin glanced at Vader. The latter 
did not need the Force to sense the 
Grand Moff's pride?it shone from 
his face. The culmination of all his 
decades of work was about to take 
place. This had been his project from 
the beginning, and it was about to 
produce the result he had always said 
it would. How could he not feel 
proud?
 "Sir," came the voice from the 
intercom, "we have picked up small 
Rebel ships leaving the moon and 
heading our way."
 Tarkin smiled, a cruel expression.
 "Shall we scramble TIEs to 
intercept?" the voice asked.
 "That won't be necessary," Tarkin 
said into the intercom. "I believe our 
gunners can use the practice."
 He turned back to Vader. "It will be 
like swatting flies."



LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES, DEATH STAR

 A tour felt a faint vibration in the 
deck beneath his chair. Whatever it 
was, he hoped fervently that it 
wouldn't interfere with his work. He 
was almost finished with the final 
stage of the plan. He concentrated on 
programming, the monitor's flickering 
light painting his face with pallor. 
Almost there . . . almost. . .
 Ah. He leaned back in satisfaction, 
feeling stiff back muscles protest. He 
had found the link in the comm 
system that P-RC3 had built for him, 
and had locked it down. A dedicated 
pipe for communications from the 
Door Control room.
 He picked up his comlink.



TIE FIGHTER PILOT BARRACKS, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Vil Dance felt the vibration through 
his boots as he passed the watch 
commander. "What's up, 
Commander?"
 "That's what it feels like when the 
guns are locking and loading full 
power charges. We got company 
come to call."
 "We scrambling?"
 "Negative. I guess they think we 
hogged all the fun last time? they're 
letting the gunners deal with this. Too 
bad."
 Vil's comlink chirped. "Oops, sorry, 
need to take that. New girlfriend is 
supposed to be cooking me dinner."
 The watch commander grinned and 
made a kissing sound.
 Vil grinned back. "I hope so," he 
said. He took a few steps away, pulled 
his comlink from his belt. "Yeah?"
 "Go," Riten's voice said. "A little 
under thirty minutes."
 "Copy. See you there."
 There was a short pause. "Right."
 Vil's mouth v/as suddenly dry. This 
was it. If he was going to change his 
mind, this was the time. He could still 
back out, stay the best pilot in the 
fleet, on the fast track for promotion.
 No. He remembered blowing up that 
shuttle of escaped prisoners. He 
remembered the nightmares he'd had 
for weeks afterward. He remembered 
the slaughter of the attacking Rebel 
fighters. And of course, he 
remembered Despayre and Alderaan.
 He didn't want to be on the side that 
performed such atrocities.
 He was going.



THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Ratua's comm buzzed. He looked at 
Memah. Nobody had the number but 
her?and Riten, the archivist. She 
looked back at him, her lovely teal 
face expressionless. He answered it. 
"Yeah?" "Go."
 "I have Memah and Rodo right 
here." "Then I won't call them. Get to 
the rendezvous point." "On our way."



ELECTRONICS CORRIDOR 7B, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Nova was standing guard on a 
restricted corridor when his comlink 
cheeped. Since he was in duty black 
instead of whites, he was able to 
answer it without routing it through a 
helmet comm. "Stihl."
 It was the archivist. "Time to take a 
walk, Sergeant."
 "Copy."
 Nova left his post and started toward 
the turbolifts.
 "What's up, Sarge?" the guard at the 
lifts asked.
 "Sudden call of nature," he said. 
"Those lamitos at the mess hall last 
night."
 The guard laughed. "I hear that. I'll 
keep an eye on your hall till you get 
back."
 "Thanks."



COMMAND CENTER CORRIDOR
 
 As Vader strode down the hall, one 
of his own crew officers hurriedly 
approached.
 "We count thirty Rebel ships, Lord 
Vader. But they're so small, they're 
avoiding our turbolasers."
 Vader's burned face twisted into its 
unseen, stiff smile. Once again, 
Tarkin had been overconfident, so 
certain his beloved monster was proof 
against anything. A fly could sting 
you if you missed swatting it. He had 
his own personal wing of TIE fighters 
on board. He would lead them out, 
and they would deal with what Tarkin 
could not.
 "We'll have to destroy them ship-to-
ship. Get the crews to their fighters." 
His officer knew the command 
referred only to Vader's elite fliers. A 
squadron would be more than enough.

ARCHITECTURAL OFFICES, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Somebody with access or clout or 
both had installed a first-rate holo-
projector in the conference room that 
had access to external cams, and a 
small crowd had gathered around the 
images flashing across the screen.
 Teela walked into the room. She said 
to one of the drafting droids, "What's 
going on?"
 "The station is apparently under 
attack by Rebel fighters," the droid 
said. "And the station's gunners seem 
to be having little success hitting 
them."
 She nodded. Of course. The 
turbolasers were designed and timed 
to track larger targets. She had seen 
the specs. "Why haven't they 
scrambled TIE fighters? That's what 
they're for, isn't it?"
 The droid said, "That is beyond my 
capability to comment on. I do 
drawings, not military tactics."
 As she watched, a pair of the 
attacking fighters, both X-wings, 
dived into one of the surface trenches, 
firing all the while.
 One of the architects laughed. 
"They're wasting their ammunition. 
Their guns're too small to penetrate 
very far into the armor."
 Teela frowned. That trench looked 
familiar . . .
 She stepped out of the conference 
room and moved to her office. She 
tapped her computer console, waved 
her hand over the reader, and brought 
up a schematic.
 Why would those fighters think they 
had a snowflake's chance in a 
supernova against the Death Star? If 
they had the plans, like she'd heard, 
they'd know the ship could withstand 
anything they could possibly fire at it 
without sustaining major structural 
damage?they could shoot themselves 
dry and whatever harm they did 
would be repaired in a couple of shifts 
as if it had never happened.
 Something nagged at her, tugging at 
the edge of her memory. Let's see, 
that was the trench that led to the 
main heat exhaust vent, wasn't it? Of 
course that vent was heavily shielded 
by both plate and magnetics, so no 
fighter would be able to penetrate it.
 So why would they try?if they had 
the plans, they'd know it would be
