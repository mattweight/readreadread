walked away from without being shot 
by both sides for my trouble. Besides, 
I'm not sure working for the Rebels 
would be any better."
 She raised herself by one elbow off 
the examining couch. It took effort, he 
noted, but she did it, the better to look 
him in the eye. "You support the 
Emperor's agenda?"
 "I have no clue what his agenda 
might be. And like I said, I'm not sure 
that the Alliance would be any better. 
Yes, they talk a good show, but so did 
Palpatine before he declared himself 
Emperor."
 "The Senate will continue to oppose 
him," she said.
 "You haven't heard? The Emperor 
has dissolved the Senate. You are out 
of a job, Princess."
 She paled, and one of the sensors 
pinged quietly, registering the 
momentary orthostasis. Uli put a hand 
on her shoulder and tried to push her 
gently back down, but she brushed his 
hand away. "When did this happen?"
 He shrugged. "I don't know. I had a 
patient who works for someone who 
was in a high-level meeting. It was 
announced right after Vader arrived 
on the station with you."
 She shook her head. "This is terrible 
news."
 "All the news is terrible," Uli said. 
"It has been since this war began."
 She looked up at him. "If there's ever 
going to be good news for any of us 
again, Uli, it has to start with us. We 
have to create it, not wait to read 
about it the next morning."
 The door slid up. Uli looked up in 
annoyance and said, "I thought I told 
you to?" He stopped. It wasn't the 
tech.
 It was Vader.
 He entered, his cloak spreading like 
black ink against the eggshell white of 
the exam room's floor. "Doctor. I trust 
your patient is well?"
 The words came out before Uli was 
aware of them. "Yes?no thanks to 
you."
 Leia laughed.
 Vader regarded him. "You are 
insubordinate, Doctor. But I have no 
time to show you the error of your 
thoughts." He gestured to Leia. 
"Come with me, Your Highness."
 For a moment, Uli and the Princess 
locked gazes. Her eyes were brown, 
he noticed.
 Barriss's eyes had been blue, he 
remembered.
 If he'd had a weapon, he might have 
used it on Vader in that brief instant 
of time, to allow her a chance to 
escape. But he was a doctor, not a 
fighter. It was not his path.
 "Good luck," he said to her.
 She nodded. "And to you."
 Vader ushered her through the door 
ahead of him with a gesture that was 
almost courtly. The panel dropped, 
and they were gone.



COMMAND CENTER, DEATH STAR
 
 Motti entered the control room to 
report to Tarkin. "We've entered the 
Alderaan system." It had been a quick 
trip, and all systems had performed 
flawlessly.
 The station was as fast as any ship in 
the Imperial Navy, and faster than 
most. The jump to lightspeed had 
been smooth, the hyperspace lanes 
had been cleared by Imperial order, 
and it seemed that it had taken no 
time at all to reach the Alderaan 
system. The superlaser was charged to 
full capacity and ready to fire.
 Tarkin nodded. He seemed about to 
speak when Vader entered, along with 
a couple of guards and the fetching 
Princess Leia Organa. Gorgeous 
woman, Motti thought. He wouldn't 
mind getting to know her better. Alas, 
she wasn't going to be with them 
much longer. A waste.
 She was hustled up to Tarkin. It 
seemed obvious that Vader's tortures 
had had little or no effect, because her 
spirit was unbroken. "Governor 
Tarkin," she said. "I should have 
expected to find you holding Vader's 
leash. I recognized your foul stench 
when I was brought on board."
 Motti suppressed a laugh. My, but 
she was a spitfire. A real shame she 
had to die.
 Tarkin favored her with a smirk. 
"Charming to the last." He reached 
out and touched her chin. "You don't 
know how hard I found it signing the 
order to terminate your life."
 She jerked her head back. "I'm 
surprised you had the courage to take 
the responsibility yourself."
 Motti held his smile in check, but 
not without effort. She might be about 
to die, but she wasn't going to cringe 
in fear. You had to respect that in an 
enemy, even a woman. Maybe 
especially a woman.
 "Princess Leia, before your 
execution, I would like you to be the 
guest at a ceremony that will make 
this battle station operational." Tarkin 
took a few steps, raised his hands to 
take in the vastness of the station, and 
turned to regard her again. "No star 
system will dare oppose the Emperor 
now."
 She sneered at him. "The more your 
tighten your grip, Tarkin, the more 
star systems will slip through your 
fingers."
 Tarkin walked back to her, pointing 
a finger for emphasis. "Not after we 
demonstrate the power of this station. 
In a way, you have determined the 
choice of the planet that will be 
destroyed first." He loomed over her, 
face-to-face. "Since you are reluctant 
to provide us with the location of the 
Rebel base, I have chosen to test this 
station's destructive power on your 
home planet of Alderaan."
 That wiped the smirk from her face.
 She said, "No! Alderaan is peaceful. 
We have no weapons! You can't 
possibly?"
 "You would prefer another target?" 
Tarkin asked. "A military target? 
Then name the system!"
 Motti watched as Tarkin crowded 
the Princess, giving her no space, no 
chance to regain her balance, either 
figuratively or literally. He leaned 
over her, nose-to-nose, backing her 
up. She was stopped by Vader 
standing behind her.
 "I grow tired of asking this," Tarkin 
told her, "so it'll be the last time. 
Where is the Rebel base?"
 Motti watched as she looked at the 
viewer. Alderaan was centered there, 
a beautiful green, white, and blue 
world, quite unaware of its impending 
danger.
 "Dantooine," she said. Her voice was 
soft. Defeated. "They're on 
Dantooine." She lowered her gaze.
 Tarkin looked up, pleased. "There, 
you see, Lord Vader, she can be 
reasonable." He looked at Motti. 
"Continue with the operation. You 
may fire when ready."
 Leia looked up in shock. "What?"
 Tarkin turned back to face her. 
"You're far too trusting. Dantooine is 
too remote to make an effective 
demonstration. But don't worry?we 
will deal with your Rebel friends soon 
enough."
 "No!" She struggled, but Vader held 
her fast.
 Motti smiled as he prepared to give 
the order. Tarkin was right. Fear was 
the key . . .



SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Tenn heard the order crackle over 
the speaker. He couldn't believe it, but 
there it was:
 "Commence primary ignition."
 He hesitated a second. Could it be 
some bizarre kind of test? To see if he 
had what it took?
 No, that was foolish. He had already 
killed the prison planet, hadn't he? 
They couldn't have any doubts about 
his loyalty, both to the Empire and to 
Governor Tarkin.
 But in a way that made it worse?
because it meant the order was real. 
He was about to destroy yet another 
world?and it wasn't a virulent jungle 
planet swarming with criminals this 
time.
 This time it was a world all too 
similar to his own homeworld.
 He was aware of his CO watching 
him. He reached up, grabbed the 
lever. All systems were green.
 His crew once again performed their 
functions flawlessly, adjusting 
switches, checking readouts, 
balancing harmonics. All too soon, 
everything was in readiness. All 
systems were go.
 Tenn felt sweat dripping down his 
neck, under that blasted helmet. He 
looked at the timer: 00:58:57.
 He pulled the lever.
 It would take a second or so for the 
tributary beams to coalesce. He 
wanted to look away from the 
monitor, but he couldn't.
 The superlaser beam lanced from the 
focusing point above the dish.
 The image of Alderaan on the screen 
was struck by the green ray.
 It took no more than an instant. Tenn 
knew that the beam's total destructive 
power was much bigger than matter-
energy conversions limited to 
realspace. At full charge, the hyper-
matter reactor provided a 
superluminal "boost" that caused 
much of the planet's mass to be 
shifted immediately into hyperspace. 
As a result, Alderaan exploded into a 
fiery ball of eye-smiting light almost 
instantaneously, and a planar ring of 
energy reflux?the "shadow" of a 
hyperspatial ripple?spread rapidly 
outward.
 The timer read: 00:59:10.
 So little time. So much damage. It 
was incredible.
 If, somehow, the Rebel Alliance 
were to win this war?not that Tenn 
Graneet could see how that would be 
possible, given what he had just 
witnessed, what he had just done?
then surely this act would condemn 
his ashes to the deepest pit they could 
find after he was executed.
 It was his job, and if he hadn't 
performed it, someone else would 
have, but his belly roiled with the 
enormity of what pulling that lever 
had caused.
 Billions of lives snuffed out. Just 
like that.
 There was no sense of triumph in it, 
none. He had not destroyed a Rebel 
base or a military target. Instead, a 
planet full of unarmed civilians had 
been . . . extinguished.
 And he had done it.
 It made him feel sick.



G-12 BARRACKS, SECTOR N-SEVEN, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Nova was taking a sonic shower to 
relax before trying once again to sleep 
when he felt a roar in his head?
soundless, but nevertheless so loud 
that it knocked him completely 
unconscious.
 When he awoke, he was lying on the 
floor of the shower plate, the hum of 
the sonics still vibrating his body. His 
nose was bleeding, and his muscles 
tremored and shook as if he'd been hit 
by a stunner on maximum. He could 
barely stand.
 Something had just happened. 
Something terrible.

MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, COMMAND 
CENTER, DEATH STAR
 
 The Imperial officer strode into the 
room, his boots echoing on the 
polished deck. Tarkin sat at the 
opposite end of the conference table, 
and Vader had taken a position near 
the wall to the left of the door. No one 
else was there save a pair of guards on 
the sides of the doorway.
 The officer came to attention.
 Tarkin looked at the man. "Yes?"
 "Our scout ships have reached 
Dantooine. They found the remains of 
a Rebel base, but they estimate that it 
has been deserted for some time. They 
are now conducting an extensive 
search of the surrounding system."
 Vader felt a small surge of triumph, 
even though the news was bad. He 
had expected this.
 As the officer turned and marched 
away, Tarkin came to his feet, 
simmering with rage. "She lied! She 
lied to us!"
 Vader was amused at Tarkin's 
outrage. Now who was too naive and 
trusting? Aloud, he said, "I told you 
she would never consciously betray 
the Rebellion."
 Tarkin took a few steps toward him. 
Vader could sense that the governor's 
anger had gotten the better of him. 
"Terminate her! Immediately!"
 Unseen under his helmet, Vader's 
tight features formed a painful grin. 
He understood Tarkin's anger?after 
all, he himself was a master of 
anger?but Princess Leia Organa 
might better serve them alive. He 
would consider the matter. Tarkin 
could not order, only suggest various 
courses and actions to him, and he 
was not averse to going along with 
those suggestions most of the time, 
since they didn't really matter. But 
Darth Vader bowed to no one's wishes 
save those of his Master, the Dark 
Lord of the Sith. Should his Master's 
wishes and Tarkin's collide, Tarkin 
would be swept away with the rest of 
history's dust without a second's 
hesitation.
 Nova hadn't really been surprised to 
be assigned as one of the guards for 
the conference room on the Command 
Level. It wasn't his normal duty, but 
he was a senior sergeant, and when 
one of the men normally at the post 
developed a sudden illness Nova had 
been tapped as a temporary 
replacement. He was the kind of 
guard they liked, adept with either 
weapons or his bare hands.
 Mostly the room was empty the 
entire shift, and there was little to do 
but think; however, toward the end of 
the shift, Governor Tarkin and Darth 
Vader had arrived. Nova could not 
help but overhear, of course, as the 
two had a discussion that ranged 
across several topics?mostly 
concerned with the next target for the 
Death Star. It seemed that the Rebels' 
main fortress had been located, and 
they were awaiting reports from the 
scouts before spacing there to destroy 
that planet as well.
 Nova was still reeling from the 
results of the most recent test. He had 
passed out in his sonic shower at 
precisely the instant that the 
superlaser had shattered the peaceful 
world of Alderaan, and he was certain 
this was no coincidence. The doctor's 
diagnosis about midi-chlorians had to 
be connected. He'd done research on it 
with the station archivist's help, and 
had come to the reluctant conclusion 
that he was somehow receptive to the 
pervasive energy field the Jedi had 
called the Force. A Force-sensitive 
was the term. It explained why he 
sometimes could anticipate the moves 
of his opponents, the skill he called 
Blink.
 He wasn't sure what to do about 
this?he wasn't even sure that 
anything could be done. It had 
evidently been with him to a certain 
degree for his whole life; it wasn't just 
going to go away. Since he seemed to 
be stuck with it and the visions it 
brought, maybe there was something 
he could do with it besides just dodge 
incoming fists.
 The door opened and a senior officer 
marched in, as stiff as if he had a 
durasteel rod for a spine.
 The man gave his report, and Nova 
kept his face stolid as he listened.
 So the girl that the doctor had 
spoken of in the cantina had given 
Tarkin and Vader a false lead. Brave, 
but not very smart, since Tarkin was 
now irritated enough to tell Vader to 
execute her.
 Once upon a time, Nova would have 
shrugged that bit of news away. It 
wasn't his business how the higher-
ups behaved; he just followed his 
orders and did his job, a good and 
loyal soldier. But if blowing up 
Despayre had been terrible, killing 
Alderaan was several orders of 
magnitude more horrifying. Billions 
of innocents had died there, not 
hardened and convicted criminals?
billions of civilians of all ages?and 
how could you in good conscience 
serve somebody who thought that was 
the way to wage war?
 It had rocked him to his core, maybe 
more because of the whole Force 
thing. But he hadn't been the only one. 
Sure, there were always some kill-
'em-all types who said they must have 
deserved it, else it wouldn't have been 
done; but there were a lot of people 
on this battle station who couldn't 
accept these actions as things even to 
be contemplated in a sane and rational 
universe. It wasn't supposed to have 
gone this far. From everything he'd 
heard it was to be merely the threat of 
mundicide. Blowing up a planet?
killing everything that lived on it?
just to make a point?
 This was his last tour, Nova decided; 
he wasn't going to stay in a military 
that would commit such atrocities. 
And if there was anything he could do 
to help prevent it from happening 
again, he ought to seriously consider 
it.
 Killing civilian populations on a 
planetary scale was evil beyond 
comprehension. Nova could fight a 
room full of men straight-up, face-to-
face, and if he had to kill half of them 
to survive, he'd do it. But he hadn't 
signed on to slaughter children asleep 
in their beds.



LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES, DECK 106, 
DEATH STAR
 
 A tour Riten considered himself a 
man of the galaxy; he had traveled far 
and wide and seen much. He had 
toured the spice mines of Kessel, 
explored the ruins of Dantooine, and 
witnessed the death of stars in the Bi-
Borran Cluster. Even though most of 
his working days had been within the 
walls of libraries and archives, he had 
also breathed the outside air of scores 
of worlds in the course of his years. 
And he had remained apolitical for all 
those years, going his own way, 
avoiding commitments to things he 
didn't think he could influence yea or 
nay.
 But not anymore. Not after 
Alderaan.
 The destruction of Despayre had 
been bad enough, as much for what it 
had portended as for the act itself. But 
Alderaan had been a peaceful world; 
its government had sympathized with 
the Rebels, true enough, but the 
Empire's reaction had been overkill in 
the most horrifyingly literal sense 
imaginable. The immensity of it 
overwhelmed him each time his 
imagination started down that killing 
road: mothers, babies, grandfathers, 
pets ... all wiped out in a heartbeat.
 He could not help but be reminded 
of the Mrlssi saying: Evil compounds 
exponentially. It was true. Such 
horrors inevitably fed upon 
themselves, mushrooming into the 
unthinkable in very short order. Atour 
could not stand to see this happen 
again. He was old, he had lived a long 
and full life, and he decided now that 
whatever days he had left, he would 
dedicate to defeating an Empire 
capable of such abominations.
 "Persee, initiate a search for weak 
points in this battle station?those that 
might be most vulnerable to internal 
sabotage."
 "That would be unwise, sir. Such a 
scan would almost certainly be 
detected, and Imperial intelligence 
operatives would undoubtedly wish to 
engage in conversation with the 
initiator of such a search. It would not 
be a pleasant conversation."
 "Then I suggest you do it 
cautiously."
 "Sir, I feel compelled to point out 
again that the risk of such a venture 
would be great."
 "And I appreciate your concern," 
Atour said. He leaned back in his 
formfit chair and steepled his fingers. 
"Do it anyway."
 The droid acknowledged this order 
and shuffled away to implement it. 
Atour sighed. He realized that P-RC3 
was going to suffer a traumatic 
memory loss in the near future. That 
would be a shame?he'd actually 
become rather fond of the droid?but 
given the gravity of what the Empire 
had done and must be made to pay 
for, the price of a droid's memory?
and one old man's life, come to that?
was small enough.



CONFERENCE ROOM, COMMAND 
CENTER, DEATH STAR
 
 The intercom cheeped, and Tarkin 
activated it. "Yes?" The voice from 
the comm said, "We've captured a 
freighter entering the remains of the 
Alderaan system. Its markings match 
those of a ship that blasted its way out 
of Mos Eisley."
 Tarkin frowned. Mos Eisley was on 
Tatooine, where the stolen battle 
station plans had, according to Vader, 
landed. Coincidence? Not likely. He 
looked at Vader, who said, "They 
must be trying to return the stolen 
plans to the Princess. She may yet be 
of some use to us."
 Tarkin considered that. Yes. While 
his anger at her deception had not 
abated, there were more important 
things at stake here than one 
prisoner's life or death. Vader was 
right. She might be useful as a decoy.
 "Best you go and personally deal 
with this, Lord Vader."



DOCKING BAY 2037, DEATH STAR
 
 Vader stalked into the bay as a 
lieutenant and several stormtroopers 
exited the captured freighter. The 
lieutenant said, "There's no one on 
board, sir. According to the log, the 
crew abandoned ship right after 
takeoff. It must be a decoy, sir; 
several of the escape pods have been 
jettisoned."
 Vader nodded. "Did you find any 
droids?"
 "No, sir. If there were any on board, 
they must also have been jettisoned."
 "Send a scanning crew aboard?I 
want every part of this ship checked."
 "Yes, sir."
 Vader was about to speak again 
when he felt a ripple in the Force. It 
was fleeting, too brief to grasp before 
it flitted away, but startling. Almost to 
himself, he said, "I sense something. 
A . . . presence I've not felt since?" 
He stopped. No. He must be mistaken. 
It could not be, after all these years . . 
.
 Abruptly, he turned away. If the 
plans were on the ship, they would be 
found; if not, then the ship was of no 
importance. As for that tingle in the 
Force . . . well, if it was indeed 
generated by who he thought it might 
be, then no doubt the man responsible 
had sensed Vader as well.
 If Obi-Wan Kenobi was really 
aboard the Death Star, then it was 
inevitable that they would meet. The 
Force would draw them together as 
surely as opposite particles in a 
vacuum.

LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES, DECK 106, 
DEATH STAR
 
 "Odd," P-RC3 said. Atour looked 
up. "What?"
 The droid turned away from the 
monitor, its data display reflecting 
from its blue durasteel chassis. 
"Someone has just accessed the main 
computer in a forward bay command 
office."
 "And this is unusual because . . . ?"
 "The access is via droid interface 
plug."
 "Which was put there for droids, if I 
am not mistaken," Atour said. "So?"
 "The accessor is requesting 
information on the location of 
terminals controlling a tractor beam 
recently used to capture a ship 
suspected of being a Rebel freighter."
 Atour frowned. "Who would do 
that? Is the tractor generator in need 
of repair?"
 "Not that I can determine."
 "And why are you bringing this to 
my attention?"
 "I have flagged operating systems to 
report unusual events for your 
protection, sir."
 "Hmm. Is there a security cam in 
that office?"
 "Yes, sir."
 "Can you access it?"
 "Not without the security codes."
 "Oh, those. Here." Atour tapped a 
ten-digit number into the computer 
console.
 "Having that code is illegal," P-RC3 
said. "You could be arrested fork."
 "That would likely be the least of my 
crimes. Access the cam."
 The droid turned back to the 
terminal. "I have visual only. No 
sound."
 "A pixel is worth a thousand bytes?
and isn't that a strange saying to be 
coming out of the mouth of an 
archivist?"
 "Sir?"
 "Never mind. The cam. Put it on my 
terminal."
 The holo over Atour's desk lit. What 
he saw was the interior of a command 
office in which were standing two 
stormtroopers, their helmets removed. 
They seemed unremarkable, although 
their haircuts were a bit long for 
regulation status. There were others as 
well who were not so unremarkable: a 
golden protocol droid, an astromech 
unit, a Wookiee with a bowcaster, and 
a balding and bearded older human in 
a hooded cloak with the cowl pulled 
back. Atour realized with slight 
surprise that the old man was dressed 
in the vestments of a Jedi Knight.
 There were also the bodies of two 
Imperial troopers lying on the deck.
 It appeared from their attitude that 
the humans were listening to the 
protocol droid. Then after a moment, 
the humans started talking to each 
other.
 "Persee, can you lip-read?"
 "Certainly, sir."
 "Tell me what they are saying."
 Persee watched the image for a 
moment. "The oldest one just said to 
the younger of the stormtroopers, 
"Your destiny lies along a different 
path from mine. The Force will be 
with you, always."
 The Force?
 As Atour digested this, the command 
office door slid up and the old man 
exited. One of the stormtroopers and 
the Wookiee had a brief conversation.
 "Sorry, sir, but I can't see the 
Wookiee clearly enough to read what 
he is saying. The older human male 
just said to the younger, 'Where did 
you dig up that old fossil?'"
 Atour frowned, perplexed. What did 
that mean?
 "The youngest one appears to be 
speaking now, but I can't see his face. 
The two humans appear agitated, 
judging by their body language."
 Atour continued to watch as both 
men stopped arguing and looked at 
the droids.
 "I surmise the droids are speaking," 
Persee said. "Now the older human 
has just said, 'Princess?'
 "'Where is she?' the younger one 
asks."
 Princess? "Persee, check the main 
computer for information on 
'Princess.'"
 The droid tapped console controls as 
Atour continued to watch the image. 
The two men were talking now, both 
somewhat agitated. The younger 
one?no more than a boy, really?
seemed to be trying to convince the 
older one of something.
 "Sir, a human female, Princess Leia 
Organa, was recently brought aboard 
by Darth Vader. A Rebel, according 
to the files, and scheduled to be 
terminated."
 Atour shook his head in incredulity. 
It seemed obvious that the two men he 
was watching were not stormtroopers, 
and that they were here due in some 
part to Princess Leia. He knew the 
name, of course. Bail Organa's 
daughter. Of the late planet Alderaan.
 The protocol droid shuffled forward 
and handed the boy a pair of 
electronic stun cuffs. The boy moved 
toward the Wookiee and attempted to 
put the cuffs on him. The Wookiee 
did not seem at all pleased with the 
idea. The boy backed away quickly, 
turned to the older man?who wasn't 
really all that old himself?and gave 
him the binders.
 "Persee? What are they saying?"
 "'. . . Chewie, I think I know what he 
has in mind.' That from the older 
one."
 The man put the cuffs on the 
Wookiee's wrists. "Ah," Atour said.
 "Sir? I don't understand."
 "They are apparently marching right 
into the nexu's den." He smiled. 
"They have come for the Princess."
 "That hardly seems wise."
 "No, it seems foolhardy in the 
extreme. How will they escape if they 
do find?aha!"
 "I am still at a loss, sir."
 "That's why they're investigating the 
tractor beam. They must mean to steal 
a ship. I'll wager that the old man?a 
Jedi, if I'm not mistaken? has gone 
to disable the device. Clever." Atour 
frowned. "Unlikely they will succeed, 
however."
 The men and the stun-cuffed 
Wookiee exited the room, leaving the 
two droids alone in the office.
 "I think we've seen enough of this," 
Atour said. "Where is the Princess 
being held?"
 P-RC3 adjusted a control on the 
console. "Level Five, Detention Block 
AA-Twenty-three."
 Atour nodded. He didn't fancy their 
chances of success, but he had to give 
them credit for bravery. He would 
have helped them, but he didn't see 
any way that he could. Detention cells 
were controlled locally; they couldn't 
be overridden by the central 
computer.
 It occurred to him then that they 
would have to take a lift up to the 
Detention Level, and they would need 
the current code to reach that level. 
Perhaps they already had access to it, 
but he doubted it.
