too close for the guards to use their 
blasters. That was about to change, 
however. The guards were backing 
away, going for their weapons. The 
game was about to be over.
 Nova felt fear welling inside him. 
Not for himself; he knew he was a 
dead man fighting. Two against 
fifteen, the latter armed with blasters? 
A win was never in those cards. But it 
was vitally important that he prolong 
the fight as long as he could, to give 
the others?
 To give them what? To give who 
what?
 He didn't know. All he knew was 
that this would be his last dance, and 
he wanted it to be the best he could 
manage. Going up against impossible 
odds, going down swinging, using 
what he knew.
 There were a lot worse ways to 
check out.
 He saw the trooper draw down on 
him, saw the blaster's muzzle aimed at 
his head, knew he could never reach it 
in time?
 Nova awoke, sitting up soaked in 
sweat, his heart hammering.
 Blast!
 The glow of the life-support 
monitors bathed the small room in 
dim blue and green lights, enough to 
see that Mantologo, the other NCO 
who was also off-shift, was sleeping 
like the dead, snoring lightly. It was 
just the two of them; the other two 
sergeants who shared the room were 
working.
 Nova sat up on the edge of his rack, 
then slid off onto the cold floor plates. 
He padded into the refresher, a small 
unit that held a sink, a toilet, and a 
tight sonic shower pad. He splashed 
tepid water onto his face, toweled it 
off, looked at himself in the small 
mirror over the sink.
 The same dream.
 This was the fourth time he'd had it 
since he'd transferred onto the battle 
station. There were slight variations in 
it?sometimes he was fighting alone; 
sometimes there were more guards, 
sometimes fewer. The last time he'd 
had it he'd been crisped by the laser's 
energy beam and "died." That had 
been bad.
 Maybe I should have the medics 
check me out, he thought.
 Yeah. Right. And wouldn't that look 
good on his record? Bad dreams? 
What kind of tough-guy martial arts 
expert are you, Stihl, going to see the 
doctor because of a dream?
 He shook his head. No. He wouldn't 
be doing that anytime soon.
 Besides, it didn't happen that often. 
He was usually able to go back to 
sleep, and he never had a repeat of the 
dream on the same night. Nova 
shrugged. Most likely it was 
something that the filters would 
eventually strain out of the air. 
Nothing to get all in a lather about. 
He'd start practicing one of the mind-
clearing meditations he knew before 
he went to bed. That might help.
 If not, well, he could learn to live 
with it. But that sure wasn't his first 
choice.

CANTINA, DECK 69, DEATH STAR
 
 Come up with a name yet?" Rodo 
asked as they looked around the 
inside of the finished cantina.
 "I think so." Officially it was going 
to be given a deck, area, and room 
number, but unofficially people liked 
descriptive names. Her Southern 
Underground establishment that had 
burned had been "the Soft Heart." 
This new one, while she didn't own it, 
was hers to run, and given where it 
was and the patrons who'd frequent it, 
Memah thought a variation on the old 
name would fit.
 "I'm calling it the Hard Heart."
 Rodo nodded. "Works for me."
 The construction droids and a couple 
of Wookiee supervisors had worked 
quickly, but as far as she could tell 
they'd done a good job. Rodo had 
inspected bits and pieces and seemed 
satisfied. The basic layout was the 
standard military pub/cantina model 
she'd seen in dozens of places 
throughout what was now Imperial 
Space. The main room was more or 
less square, with the bar running 
nearly the length of the east wall. In 
the northeast corner was a small stage, 
just in case they were lucky enough to 
get live talent for skits or music, or in 
case some of the drunker patrons felt 
moved to render heartfelt versions of 
their favorite songs. 
Unisex/unispecies refreshers were 
sited off the northwest wall, and a 
manager's office next to those. There 
were three entrances?one each on 
the south and north walls, plus an 
emergency exit on the west wall 
behind the bar.
 Twenty tables filled the room, bolted 
to slides inset into the deck, each with 
half a dozen low-backed stools 
adjustable for height. If a large party 
came in, as many as five tables in any 
row could be scooted together into a 
larger module. The stools could be 
also moved, but normally were held in 
place with electric locks controlled by 
the tender from behind the bar. People 
could adjust seating as necessary for 
their size or number, but once all was 
in place the tender could flip a switch 
and lock the stools. That way, if the 
crowd got rowdy, they wouldn't be 
using the furniture on one another. 
Not that such a scenario was likely 
with Rodo on the job, but better safe 
than trashed.
 The consumables were all behind the 
bar, on shelves running up the wall or 
underneath the counter?liquor, puffs, 
eats. Food was generally pull-tab 
heated modmeals; you could live on 
them, but that was about all. A cantina 
was not the place for fine dining.
 The ceiling and tabletops had 
blowers and vacuums built in, and the 
table's units could be controlled either 
at the table or by tenders or servers at 
the bar. If the boys at table six were 
smoking pickled rankweed and 
producing billowing clouds of 
fragrant, intoxicating blue smoke, 
they could adjust the vacuums so it 
didn't drift like fog over the girls at 
table seven, who were licking up 
spirals of kik-dust, or the drinkers at 
table five chugging down steins of 
Andoan ale. The air scrubbers weren't 
100 percent, of course, but effective 
enough.
 The serving droid, SU-B713, aka 
Essyou, rolled up, looking very much 
like a large domed ale can. Essyou 
had been programmed with a 
feminine vocabulator: "Stocks are 
topped off, boss. We are ready to soak 
and smoke."
 Memah smiled. Whoever had 
programmed SU-B713 must have had 
fun doing it. "Good. Run a final check 
on the credit interface, make sure all 
the readers are online."
 A multicolored light array sparkled 
on the droid's computer screen. 
"Copy, money readers are green and 
mean. I'm going to go run internal 
systems checks and then defrag, keep 
my drive alive."
 After the droid rolled away, Rodo 
said, "Professional comedians 
starving on the HNE circuit and we 
get a head server droid who does 
stand-up."
 "Hey, if it keeps the troops happy."
 "Yeah, but how am I going to get my 
workouts if the patrons all behave 
themselves?"
 She grinned. "Come on, you can 
help me adjust the scrubber in the 
oversized 'fresher stall. We get a 
couple of Hutts or a Drack in there, 
we don't want the air circ to be 
overwhelmed."
 With the last few tasks completed, 
they were probably as ready as they 
were going to get, Memah decided. 
Everything she could think of had 
been seen to as best as could be 
managed, but she was still a little 
nervous. A new cantina opening was a 
fluttery-gut thing at best. True, it was 
just a cantina, nothing huge in the 
cosmic scheme of the Galactic 
Empire, but when it was your cantina, 
you wanted it to go well. A station 
like this would be around for decades, 
and a good reputation out of the box 
never hurt business. She was, after all, 
getting at least a small piece of the 
action, and the better things went, the 
more she would make.



ISD STEEL TALON
 
 Systems reports are all normal, 
Admiral." Motti nodded. This 
tiresome business on the ship had to 
be done, of course, but he wanted to 
get it done quickly and return to the 
station. He felt an almost superstitious 
concern when he was off-site for very 
long. Yes, Tarkin was the Moff, and 
he was in charge, but the real running 
of the station fell to Motti?as well it 
should. No man in the Imperial Navy 
had more of an interest and 
investment in the "Death Star" than 
Admiral Conan Antonio Motti.
 The captain reporting saluted and 
departed, and Motti glanced up at the 
chrono inset into the bridge wall. In 
another hour he could leave, shuttle 
back to the station, and get back to 
important functions. Because, 
superstition aside, there were also 
practical, real-world reasons for Motti 
to be wary of long enforced absences 
from the station. The biggest being 
that he didn't trust General Bast or 
General Tagge.
 Both were officers from the Imperial 
Army contingent, and technically both 
outranked Admiral Motti, despite the 
fact that the station was a navy 
venture. Tarkin, of course, being 
Grand Moff, was above the petty 
distinctions of service branches. He 
outranked everyone.
 Motti feared Tagge the most. The 
House of Tagge was an old and 
wealthy family, well respected in the 
corridors of power back on Imperial 
Center. Tagge held sway with the 
Emperor, and he knew how to use it. 
He'd used it to land his current 
position as adviser to Tarkin.
 Bast, Tagge's subordinate, was also a 
focus of worry. Although possessed 
of no personal aspirations beyond 
serving the Empire, he was loyal to 
both Tagge and Tarkin, and might 
become an obstacle at some future 
point.
 Motti had tried to enlist Tarkin, 
subtly, in the idea that the man who 
controlled the battle station, once it 
was fully operational, would 
effectively be the most powerful 
person in the galaxy. It was true that 
the Emperor and Vader supposedly 
had that mystical connection with the 
Force, and Motti well remembered, as 
a young man, witnessing firsthand 
some of the astonishing 
accomplishments of the Jedi during 
the Clone Wars. But not even 
superhuman abilities could stand 
against a weapon that could blow a 
planet to pieces.
 In any event Tarkin had either not 
picked up on the hints or, more likely, 
he had, but had chosen to keep his 
options open?and to himself. No 
matter. If Tarkin wanted to pretend 
loyalty to the withered old man who 
sat at the head of the Empire, that was 
fine?for now. Motti knew the ins and 
outs of the station better than anyone. 
And he had developed a certain 
loyalty among the senior officers. 
Eventually, the time would come. If 
Tarkin wasn't with him, then it was 
the Grand Moff's misfortune. The 
risks were high, but so were the 
stakes. To be the ultimate power in 
the galaxy?maybe the universe? 
Who could walk away from that, 
given the chance to have it?

HALF A LIGHT-SECOND FROM DOCK 
ONE-A, EQUATORIAL TRENCH, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Pull up, Kendo!" Vil Dance said. He 
waited for the acknowledgment, but 
none seemed to be forthcoming. 
"Lieutenant Kendo, have you gone 
deaf?"
 Vil's own TIE vibrated as he leaned 
into the sharp turn, port and "up," 
accelerating hard to avoid the robotic 
target drones grouped in a tight 
formation only six hundred klicks 
ahead of him.
 "Pulling up, sir," Kendo finally said. 
Through the commset, the man's 
voice sounded?what? Laconic?
 No, more like . . .  bored.
 Vil watched Kendo's ship peel away 
from the course that would have 
smashed him into the drones in 
another two heartbeats. A sliver is as 
good as a parsec, the old pilots' 
saying went, and while that might be 
true, following orders was more 
important.
 A fact that new recruit Lieutenant 
Nond Kendo badly needed to learn.
 The rest of the squad hung back a 
few hundred klicks, watching the 
newbie Kendo and the veteran Dance 
as they made their first warm-up run 
at the targets. They kept the chatter 
down, because it didn't take a 
petahertz processor to see that their 
squadron leader was ready to bite 
somebody's head off and spit it 
halfway to the Core, given this 
newbie's performance.
 They all thought they were the 
hottest pilots to ever lay hands on a 
stick when they first arrived, every 
one of them. Vil had felt the same 
way. But he had learned pretty 
quickly that when the squad leader 
told you to do something there were 
reasons, and if you decided you knew 
more about flying than he did, it could 
cost you. Severely.
 There was no way he was going to 
have anything less than perfect 
performances on his first few weeks 
at his new assignment. He'd shipped 
over from the Steel Talon to the Death 
Star only a couple of weeks before, 
and he wanted to make sure that the 
brass had no reason to rethink their 
decision.
 This was a simple training exercise; 
each of the squad members got solo 
runs at the target drones, with 
Lieutenant Commander Dance behind 
them, looking over their shoulders. 
The first pass was to check range and 
distance. On the second, it was 
targeting lasers only?you painted the 
target, got the kill electronically, and 
the squad leader rated your run. Only 
on the third pass did you get to shoot 
for real. The drones?old freighters 
refitted for naval exercises?were 
heavily armored, and it would take a 
lot more than a blast from a single 
TIE to seriously damage them, so a 
dozen squads could hit them before 
they had to be repaired; the Imperial 
Navy thus saved a few credits. Where 
you put your shot was important, and 
you learned how to do it by full-speed 
runs and full-power guns?but only in 
steps and by the numbers.
 Vil had seen Kendo's targeting lasers 
sparkle on the lead drone, and the 
practice shot had been pretty good to 
his eyes. He checked his ship recorder 
on the second run's completion, and it 
confirmed his opinion as they curved 
around for the third and final run.
 Okay, fine, the kid could shoot. 
Which got him no slice at all in Vil's 
eyes?he was still a potential 
supercritical reaction.
 "Listen up, Kendo, and pay close 
attention. You fire five seconds out, 
target the aft sensor array, and break 
off immediately, you copy?"
 There was a two-second pause, then: 
"Ah, copy, Squad Leader. Request 
permission to target the aft pilot port. 
I can hit either gun?you call it."
 "I am sure you can, Lieutenant, but 
that's not the assignment I just gave 
you, is it?"
 Another pause. "No, sir."
 "Good. You're teachable, at least. 
Now bring it around and let's run it by 
the book."
 "Copy."
 That last word had an unmistakable 
ring of Contempt. It was as if all the 
arrogance of a young, full-of-himself, 
simulator-trained pilot was 
compressed into it. Hey, it said, I can 
do this! I don't need some gutless old 
squad commander I can fly circles 
around holding my hand!
 He couldn't help but grin. He had 
only three years on Kendo; 
nevertheless, sometimes he felt more 
like thirty years older than the 
newbies. He made no reply, just hung 
zero and watched Kendo make a 
sharp and well-executed half roll as 
he lined up for his run. The kid could 
fly. But could he do what he was told?
 Ahead, the six drones sailed serenely 
through the blackness. They were 
programmed to activate defensive 
weapons?low-powered beams that 
were enough to rattle your teeth if one 
hit your fighter, but not strong enough 
to cause any real damage. Anybody 
paying attention could avoid these, 
but it took practice. In the real world, 
even a freighter could get lucky and 
blow you out of the void, and that's 
what training was for, to teach you 
how to avoid such mishaps. TIEs 
were fast, but they had neither life 
support nor shielding; a solid hit from 
any real weapon could crisp you like a 
mulch fritter.
 Kendo accelerated?a hair faster 
than called for, but Vil held off 
calling him on it. Let's see what you 
can do with it, kid . . . 
 The newbie zipped toward the target. 
Vil checked his Doppler-ping. Seven 
seconds. Six . . .  five . . . 
 "Shoot," Vil said.
 No response.
 "Kendo, shoot and pull up!"
 But Kendo kept boring in, drawing 
closer to the lead drone.
 The stupid mopak! He's going for 
the pilot port!
 "Pull up, Lieutenant! That's an 
order! Pull up, now!"
 The drone fired its port guns. The 
attenuated strobe hit Kendo's fighter. 
It wasn't enough to hurt him, but it 
must have been enough to startle him. 
He fired, flared to port?
 Too late.
 A quarter second sooner on the turn 
and he'd have missed, but as it was the 
TIE's starboard solar array hit the 
drone's nose. The impact tore the 
array from the fighter, the energy 
collection coils unraveling 
spasmodically, like a beheaded snake; 
the power lines sparked in cold 
vacuum as they were torn apart. The 
housing snapped and the impact spun 
the craft into a wild tumble.
 Vil shoved the stick, feeling g-force 
slap him hard, knowing it was far too 
late to do anything but watch. "Kill 
the power! Kill the?!"
 The fuel tank separated from the 
hull. The seal held, but the fuel line 
stretched, stretched . . .  Vil could see 
it happen, slowly, as if time had 
stalled out . . . 
 The line snapped, spewing the 
radioactive gas in a sudden cloud 
toward the tumbling craft. 
Something?a shattered circuit board, 
perhaps?sparked. There was a 
soundless, eye-burning flash?
 "Blast!" Vil shouted. "Blast, blast, 
blast!"

THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DECK 69, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Ratua's identification wasn't 
bombproof, but short of a destructive 
analysis it would pass any casual scan 
by anybody?not, he marveled yet 
again, that anybody seemed to give a 
braz's behind enough to bother to ask 
to see it. From the look of this station, 
it would, when finished, be 
impregnable from outside attack; 
nobody was going to be able to throw 
much of anything at it that was going 
cause it any real problems. And yet 
here he was, walking around like it 
was his personal ship, ostensibly a 
contractor. Had he been a Rebel 
saboteur, he could have been busy 
causing a world of problems 
absolutely unchecked for weeks. How 
ironic was that?
 Of course he wasn't a Rebel of any 
kind. He didn't have much use for 
politics, never had, couldn't see that 
he ever would. For a man in his, ah, 
profession, whoever was in charge?
Empire, Alliance, his dear old uncle 
Tunia?didn't really matter. Unless 
Black Sun managed to take over, 
whoever ran the show would want to 
see Ratua stashed in a cell 
somewhere.
 But he wasn't in a cell now; in fact, 
he had it pretty cushy. Plenty of 
credits stashed here and there, a fake 
identity that nobody questioned, even 
a legitimate, semi-private room, 
courtesy of a bribe to a poor clerk 
with a slight gambling problem. 
Everything a man might want.
 Okay, almost everything. He could 
use a little female companionship, and 
he was working on that. A new 
cantina had just opened a few levels 
from where he roomed. He'd heard 
people talking about the place, and it 
sounded like fun, so he was on his 
way to check it out. He wasn't big on 
chems, but he didn't mind having an 
ale now and then to brighten up a dull 
evening.
 The cantina, which had a small 
glowing sign that read THE HARD 
HEART above the double portal, 
seemed fairly busy. He stepped in 
through the air and caught the smells 
of a working pub?fragrant smoke, 
warm beverages, some body odors 
from patrons who should have 
showered before they came in. Mostly 
navy guys, some contractors, more 
males than females, which was hardly 
surprising. Most of the customers 
were human, or humanoid stock close 
enough that it was hard to tell the 
difference. Lighting was low enough 
to afford a kind of privacy, but not so 
dim it didn't offer a useful spectrum. 
His species could see a little deeper 
into the ultraviolet than some, but not 
as far into the infrared as others. Still, 
he wouldn't be bumping into the walls 
here.
 The tables were mostly full, but 
there were a few empty spaces at the 
bar, which ran most of the right-hand 
wall from where he'd entered. Ratua 
moved through the crowded tables, 
being careful, with an ease born of 
long practice, not to bump anybody or 
loom into anyone's space 
unexpectedly. Surprise some folks 
and they'd shoot without a second 
thought, and military types were 
faster on the trigger than a lot of 
civilians.
 But it looked like that wouldn't be a 
problem here. He noticed a sigil over 
the mirror behind the bar: u. Stood for 
"unarmed." That was a good idea. 
Navy guys seemed to enjoy wearing a 
sidearm everywhere they went; get 
them soused and angry, and stray 
blaster bolts could be a problem. Bad 
enough if you annoyed somebody to 
the point where he was ready to pull 
his weapon and cook you; even worse 
if you were minding your own 
business and you caught a bolt aimed 
at somebody else.
 Ratua achieved the bar. There were a 
couple of droid servers working the 
floor, one behind the bar, and a most 
attractive Twi'lek woman with lovely 
teal-colored skin that showed 
wherever her short-sleeved coverall 
left her bare?places that added up to 
a satisfyingly large number.
 "How may I serve you?" one of the 
droids said.
 "House ale," he said.
 "Two credits. Your debit number?"
 "Cash." Ratua dropped two coins 
into the droid's cash drawer which 
extruded from its torso to receive 
them. After a moment, the droid 
tendered a mug of amber-colored ale 
with a centimeter of frothy foam for a 
head.
 "Thanks," Ratua said. The ale was 
cold, crisp, with a hint of something 
tart under the hops. Nice.
 He turned slightly, mug in hand, and 
observed the room.
 Next to the far wall, just to the right 
of the second entrance, stood a large 
human. He was watching the patrons 
without looking at anyone in 
particular. Ratua felt the man's gaze 
touch him and move on. This would 
be in-house security and, from the 
looks of him, not a fellow with whom 
you'd want to argue. Ratua had seen 
many violent men on many planets, 
many of whom were just naturally 
mean, and some who had a certain 
competent look about them that 
bespoke training and ability. This guy 
was one of those. Step crooked here 
and you'd find yourself 
unceremoniously displaced to the 
outside corridor. Start a real fuss and 
you would, clearly, soon wish you 
hadn't.
 "That's Rodo," a female voice said 
from behind the bar. "He doesn't bite. 
He doesn't have to."
 Ratua looked. The Twi'lek woman 
stood there, smiling at him. He 
nodded, saluted her with his ale. "And 
I would guess that a sensible person 
would not care to become the object 
of Rodo's irritation."
 "In that, you would be correct. I'm 
Memah Roothes. I run the place."
 Ratua nodded again. He considered 
giving her his fake identity, but for 
some reason he could not begin to 
understand, he went with his real 
name instead. "Celot Ratua Dil," he 
said. "I liked the joint when I walked 
in, and I like it even better now that 
we've met."
 "Oh, a ladies' man." Her voice was 
amused, but there was also a hint of 
interest. At least, he hoped so.
 "Not me, Memah Roothes," he 
replied. "Just one who appreciates 
good ale and beautiful females."
 "Welcome to the Hard Heart, Celot 
Ratua Dil. You're a contractor?"
 "Actually, I recently escaped from 
the prison planet. I'm just conning my 
way along."
 She raised an appreciative eyebrow. 
"A sense of humor is worth a lot 
around here."
 He looked around, noting the bright 
colors and decorations that softened 
but didn't completely disguise the 
hard angles and general severity of 
the architecture. Impressive as the 
Empire's new weapon was, it wasn't 
going to win any design awards. "I 
can see that. I guess there's more than 
one reason for calling it the Death 
Star. And," he added, "call me Ratua, 
please." He smiled and raised his mug 
again. "May I buy you a drink?"
 "Too early to start this shift," 
Memah Roothes said. "But if you're 
still here in an hour or so, maybe I'll 
take you up on that."
 Ratua grinned. "A herd of wild 
banthas couldn't drag me away." She 
turned aside to serve a new customer, 
and he watched her, admiring the lithe 
way she moved. Oh, yes, he was 
definitely going to be spending some 
quality time in here.

OPERATING THEATER, MEDCENTER, 
DEATH STAR
 
 The surgery was not going as well as 
it should have. Uli was getting 
frustrated.
 "Get a pressor on that bleeder, stat," 
he said.
 The surgical assistant, an MD-S3 
droid, was a stationary unit built into 
the suite. It used a thin and flexible 
arm to clamp a field reader onto the 
cut vein; the flow of blood stopped. 
The droid adroitly sponged up the 
blood in the cavity, said, "Sponge 
four," aloud, removed the sponge 
from the endoscopic incision, and 
dropped the soaked pledge into the 
waste bin.
 "Wipe," Uli said.
 The droid used another of its 
multiple arms to run a sterile cloth 
over Uli's forehead, blotting away the 
perspiration that threatened to run into 
his eyes. There were anti-sweat films 
that could be sprayed on to 
temporarily keep perspiration at bay, 
but Uli didn't like them; most of them 
made him itch.
 Carving humans and humanoids was 
generally no problem for him?he 
could do clone surgery in his sleep, 
might actually have done so a couple 
of times back when he was in the 
field, working long shifts and 
patching up scores of wounded every 
day. But natural genetics sometimes 
threw a sport at you, a body that 
wasn't built exactly the same way 
most of that particular species were 
normally constructed. The navy major 
here on the surgical table was one of 
those sports, and if Uli didn't figure 
out what he needed to know, and fast, 
the major could become an interesting 
statistic.
 Three hours earlier, a forty-year-old 
human male from the planet Bakura 
had presented to the screening medic 
complaining of nausea, loss of 
appetite, low-grade fever, and pain in 
his abdomen. Symptoms were 
classically consistent with an 
inflamed appendix. The medical 
examiner made the diagnosis and sent 
the patient along for surgery.
 Normally a surgical droid would 
have handled an operation like this, 
quickly and efficiently. But the battle 
station was still understaffed and 
underequipped. So Uli had shrugged 
and scrubbed. It should have been a 
routine appendectomy, the kind of ho-
hum surgery any first-year resident 
could do one-handed. Except when 
Uli shoved an endoscope into the 
major to find the inflamed appendix, 
he encountered a slight problem:
 It wasn't there.
 At least, it wasn't where it was 
supposed to be. This was impossible, 
but Uli didn't waste time questioning 
the image on the screen. "Do a 
tomographic axial scan and find that 
appendix," he told the MD droid.
 "Yes, Doctor," the droid replied. Its 
imaging scanners hummed. A thin 
green line appeared and moved from 
the patient's groin to his chest, 
mapping the length and width of the
