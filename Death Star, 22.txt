 Well, he couldn't magically open cell 
doors for them, but finding the proper 
protocol for section egress and 
feeding it to the lift they would be 
taking was the work of only a few 
moments.
 "Good luck," Atour said softly, after 
transmitting the code. "You'll need it."
 As for himself, what he needed was 
a drink.

THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Memah had asked Rodo to remove 
the few patrons who were having too 
much fun, and what was left was a 
somber crowd; mostly people who 
kept their conversations to themselves 
or had conversations with themselves. 
Either way, they did it quietly.
 Rodo and Nova Stihl sat at the bar, 
with Ratua. It was apparent that the 
bond he and Nova had formed on the 
prison planet was stronger than their 
differences as guard and prisoner. 
Memah was glad to see that.
 There were a couple of Alderaanians 
in one corner, and they just sat there, 
not saying much, not drinking much; 
just staring into some personal 
distance.
 One of the pilots and his 
companion?an architect, Memah had 
learned?also sat at the bar, talking 
quietly but intensely. Apparently the 
pilot was one of Nova's martial arts 
students, a double ace named Vil 
Dance. The woman was named Teela 
Kaarz.
 An older man entered the cantina?
Memah recognized him as having 
been in before, but she didn't know 
who he was. He walked to where Stihl 
and Rodo and Ratua sat, and was 
greeted by the sergeant.
 For herself, Memah tended the bar, 
made drinks, and when there was a 
lull, drifted over to talk to Green-
Eyes. It felt like a memorial service, 
and, in its own way, it was.
 A pair of troopers entered and 
moved to a table near the 
Alderaanians. They ordered ales and 
seemed oblivious to the generally 
hushed mood in the cantina. Memah 
was considering having Rodo throw 
them out, too, when one of the two 
said something loud enough to carry 
to the bar:
 "Guess the Rebel scum won't be 
giving us much trouble after 
Alderaan, hey?"
 Rodo was already up and moving 
when one of the Alderaanians stood 
and stepped over to the soldiers' table.
 "Rodo," Memah said.
 He stopped, turned, and looked at 
her. She held up her hand in a wait-a-
second gesture.
 The soldier glanced up at the man 
standing next to him and probably 
wasn't impressed. The Alderaanian 
was slightly built, short, and hardly 
seemed a threat. "What can I?"
 That was as far as he got. The 
smaller man swung a fist that was 
driven by grief and rage, and the 
soldier fell out of his chair and hit the 
deck, hard.
 "Go," Memah said to Rodo.
 Rodo was there before the second 
soldier could do more than get to his 
feet. He grabbed him by the neck. 
"Out," he said.
 "The frip you say! Nobody punches 
a trooper and?"
 Rodo tightened his grip on the man's 
neck. The trooper suddenly became 
very quiet.
 "Out," Rodo repeated. "On your own 
or with my help. Get your buddy and 
get gone."
 The second soldier was not a fool. 
He nodded, bent, and helped his 
dazed friend to his unsteady feet. 
They headed for the door.
 The Alderaanian, fists still clenched 
in simmering rage, face red, stood 
there glaring at Rodo. Memah knew 
that even though he didn't have a 
prayer against the big bouncer, he 
would still swing on him if Rodo tried 
to evict him.
 Rodo knew it also. He glanced at 
her.
 She shook her head: Leave him be.
 Rodo nodded, said something too 
soft to hear to the smaller man, and 
returned to the bar. After a moment, 
the Alderaanian, as if in a dream-like 
trance, shuffled back to his seat. His 
motions were stiff, droid-like, and he 
sat down heavily.
 Rodo returned to the bar, and 
Memah moved to meet him. "What 
did you say to him?"
 "I told him I was sorry. That his 
table was comped, and that if anybody 
else said anything that stupid, to let 
me handle it?I could hit harder than 
he could."
 Next to him, Nova said, "I dunno. 
That was as good a punch as I've ever 
seen."
 Nobody replied to that.
 Nova indicated the older man and 
said, "This is Commander Riten. He 
runs the library."
 Memah nodded. "Commander."
 "Call me Atour," he said. "I don't 
much care for the rank or its 
associations right now."
 Memah nodded. "I hear that."
 She looked at the door and saw Dr. 
Divini come in. He came straight to 
the bar, where he was greeted by the 
group and introduced to the librarian 
and the young couple.
 "Missing all the fun, Doc," Nova 
said. "That little Alderaanian in the 
corner just decked a soldier twice his 
size."
 Uli nodded as Memah, unasked, put 
a stein of ale in front of him. "Rodo 
didn't throw him out?"
 "Our sympathies do not lie with the 
Imperial military tonight," Memah 
said.
 Uli nodded again. "Nor mine. I feel 
tainted just being on this station."
 That got a chorus of agreement.
 "There ought to be something we 
can do about this," Nova said.
 Rodo said, "What'd you have in 
mind, Sarge? Challenging Darth 
Vader to a death match?"
 "Maybe."
 "That wouldn't help," Uli said. "The 
Imperial machine is too big. Nobody 
can stand against it. Witness 
Alderaan."
 "So what does a person with any 
sense of justice do?" Memah asked. 
"Shrug it off and go on about his or 
her business?"
 Riten, who had been quietly nursing 
his drink, shook his head. To Nova, 
he said, "As a martial arts expert, 
what do you do if you have an 
opponent who is bigger, stronger, 
faster, better trained, and armed?and 
who has many friends?"
 Nova shrugged. "Haul your glutes 
away, fast."
 "Precisely," Riten said.
 They all turned to look at him.
 "At the very least, you don't have to 
abet a murderous thug."
 Dance, the TIE pilot, spoke up: 
"Refusing a direct order gets you sent 
to the detention cells. How's that 
going to do you or anybody else any 
good?"
 "Well," Riten said, "you might not 
be part of the solution tucked away in 
a cell, but at least you won't be part of 
the problem."
 "Some choice," Dance said.
 "There are other choices," Riten 
said.
 "Really? What?"
 The archivist regarded his drink as if 
it were possible to read the future in 
it. "You could leave."
 Dance laughed, and it was far more 
bitter than amused. "Yeah. And just 
how would you pull that off? Nobody 
leaves the Death Star without the 
express permission of the powers-
that-be. Even pilots like me?you 
can't get far in a TIE fighter, unless 
you have one of the new hyperdrive-
equipped x-ones I've been hearing 
about, and there aren't but a couple of 
those on the whole station. We have 
more weapons than a naval armada?
tractor beams, turbolasers, and a 
bunch of bored, trigger-happy gunners 
who'd like nothing better than to shoot 
anything that moves. Leaving isn't 
exactly an option."
 "But if it was? What if you could 
go? Would anybody here exercise that 
choice?"
 There was a moment of silence. 
"We're talking hypothetically here, 
not real conspiracy to treason, right?" 
Nova said.
 "Of course. Just a what-if 
conversation among friends."
 "I'd go," Memah said.
 They looked at her. "You aren't in 
the military," Ratua said. "You didn't 
have anything to do with blowing up 
Alderaan. You're a civilian. It's not 
like you pulled the lever."
 "Imagine what that must feel like," 
Kaarz said.
 "But I am here," Memah said, in 
answer to Ratua. "And I know what 
the Death Star can do?what it's 
already done. I serve drinks to people 
like that soldier the little guy knocked 
down, who not only think it's okay to 
kill planets full of innocents but 
actually take pride in it." She shook 
her head hard enough to swing her 
lekku. "I'd go in a heartbeat."
 Kaarz nodded. "Me, too. Of course, 
I'm a prisoner, and when it all settles 
down, I doubt that the Empire will 
have much use for me."
 "Assuming the Empire wins," Rodo 
said.
 "Can't really assume anything else," 
Dance said. "We all know what this 
battle station can do. If they can build 
one, they can build more? maybe 
even bigger than this one. The Rebels 
don't have a chance."
 "Perhaps," Riten said. "But wars are 
not won by technology alone. There's 
always a new version of the ultimate 
weapon being developed, and 
historically they've never been enough 
to put an end to war."
 "Peace is found neither in hot blood 
nor in cold sweat," Nova said.
 Riten looked at him in mild surprise. 
"The Fallacy of War, by Codus 
Romanthus. One doesn't often 
encounter a soldier who can quote 
obscure philosophers."
 Nova drained the last of his ale. "I'm 
sensitive." He belched.
 "I'd go," Uli said. "I'd have bailed a 
hundred times already if there had 
been any real opportunity."
 "Me, too. What about you, Sarge?" 
That from Ratua.
 "Yeah, count me in. Not just because 
my head nearly exploded when they 
burned Alderaan, but because it's 
wrong. People get killed in war, but 
it's one thing to shoot a guy shooting 
at you; it's another to go to his house 
and burn it down with his wife and 
kids inside."
 Dance said, "Yeah. One on one 
against another pilot, I'm good. What 
the Empire did to Despayre and 
Alderaan? That's not right. Next 
planet might be one of our 
homeworlds?nobody's safe, 
anywhere."
 "All very high-minded of us," Rodo 
said, "but we don't have that choice, 
do we?"
 Riten said, "Maybe we do."
 They all turned to look at him again.
 "What are you talking about?" Nova 
asked.
 Riten said, "I'm an archivist. Over 
the years I've learned ways to obtain 
all kinds of information that isn't 
supposed to be accessible."
 "Yeah?so?" Ratua said.
 "Knowledge is power," Riten said. 
"What if you knew the entry and 
takeoff codes for an Imperial shuttle 
that was fueled and ready to fly? 
What if you had the passcodes that 
would keep the station's gunners from 
firing on you when you left? Or the 
tractor beams from locking on to 
you?"
 "Big what-ifs," Rodo said.
 "Indeed. But?again, hypothetically 
and just for the sake of this 
discussion?suppose that I could lay 
hands on this information. Should I 
bother?"
 The group was quiet for what 
seemed a long time. Finally, it was 
Nova who broke the silence.
 "Yeah," he said. "Go ahead and 
bother."

CONFERENCE ROOM, COMMAND 
LEVEL, DEATH STAR
 
 Vader stood at just inside the door, 
the guards flanking him, talking to a 
frankly incredulous Tarkin.
 "He is here," he said.
 "Obi-Wan Kenobi? What makes you 
think so?"
 To anyone with a connection to the 
Force, the question would not need an 
answer or an explanation. Even 
though Vader had thought initially to 
brush it off?he had, for so many 
years, hoped to feel that presence that 
at first he thought he'd imagined it?
he knew. He said, "A tremor in the 
Force. The last time I felt it was in the 
presence of my old Master."
 Tarkin stood. "Surely he must be 
dead by now."
 "Don't underestimate the Force," 
Vader said, though he knew it was 
pointless. The man could not 
understand.
 "The Jedi are extinct. Their fire has 
gone out of the universe."
 The intercom on the table chimed. 
Tarkin moved toward it, continuing to 
speak. "You, my friend, are all that's 
left of their religion."
 No, Tarkin could not understand. He 
had no way of grasping the concept. It 
was like trying to explain color to 
someone blind from birth.
 "Yes?" Tarkin said into the 
intercom.
 The voice from the unit was terse: 
"We have an emergency alert in 
Detention Block AA-Twenty-three."
 Tarkin frowned. He obviously knew 
the significance of that location. "The 
Princess? Put all sections on alert!"
 Vader did not need the confirmation, 
but this new event might help 
convince Tarkin. He said, "Obi-Wan 
is here. The Force is with him."
 Tarkin, always quick to shift stances 
when he realized it was necessary, 
said, "If you're right, he must not be 
allowed to escape."
 It was a reasonable conclusion for 
someone who did not know their 
history. But wrong. "Escape is not his 
plan. I must face him. Alone."
 Vader turned and strode out of the 
room. Now that he was certain his old 
Master was on this station, he would 
be able to find him. The Force was 
sometimes maddeningly inexact. 
There were times when, even 
knowing what he was, you could 
stand next to a Jedi Master and not 
feel his power; at other times you 
could sense him on the other side of a 
planet or halfway across a stellar 
system?distance was no barrier to 
the Force. The swirls of energy often 
hid as much as they revealed. But 
Vader knew Obi-Wan was here, and 
he knew he would be able to find him.
 Find him and, after all these years of 
waiting, destroy him.



GUARD UNIT LOCKERS, DECK 17, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Nova arrived for his shift only a few 
minutes late, still chewing on the 
conversation in the cantina. He had 
gotten most of his armor on? and 
why they had to wear that inside the 
battle station made no sense at all to 
him. The eighteen-piece suit was a 
pain to don, and it offered only 
limited protection against a regulation 
power blaster, anyway. But regs were 
regs.
 The lieutenant suddenly turned from 
the comm board and yelled at him: 
"Sergeant Stihl, we have intruders! 
There's a breakout on Level Five, 
Detention Block AA-Twenty-three. 
Take a squad and get over there!"
 Stihl stared at the lieutenant. 
Intruders? A breakout? How was that 
possible?
 "Sergeant! Move out!"
 "Copy, sir, on our way! Bretton, 
Zack, Dash, Alix, Kai, with me! 
Mahl, Cy, Dex, Nate, on point! Move 
out, people!"
 The squad hustled out of the 
barracks and into the hall, the sound 
of
 their armor rattling as they moved. 
The corridors were strangely deserted, 
it seemed to Nova, which he chalked 
up to luck. Fewer people meant fewer 
civilian casualties.
 "Who are we after, Sarge?" That 
from Dash.
 Nova didn't know. Who were they 
after?
 Well, kark it, he'd know them if he 
saw them.
 "Just shoot who I tell you to," he told 
the trooper. Then he raised his voice 
to include the rest of the squad: 
"Double-time it, people!"
 They ran through the gray-and-black 
halls, following the four guards on 
point, their sidearms held up, fingers 
outside the trigger guards, as per 
regulations. The ceilings and floors 
were covered with blaster-proof 
absorbital, so if somebody 
accidentally cooked off a round it 
wouldn't do any damage. If you 
carried your weapon pointed at the 
floor, however, there was a good 
chance in a crowd that you'd shoot 
somebody's foot off, and the walls 
and vent grates weren't all that sturdy, 
either.
 The corridor branched ahead. As 
they approached, Nova desperately 
tried to remember which one led to D-
Unit. Ahead, a blaster bolt sizzled 
through a cross corridor, and the four 
guards on point skidded to a stop, 
then moved ahead slowly toward the 
intersection to peer around it.
 Nova suddenly realized that this was 
one of his dreams. It was as if he had 
been here before, seen the events that 
were now unfolding.
 "Aaahhhh!" Somebody beyond the 
bend in the corridor screamed, and a 
moment later half a dozen troopers 
barreled around the corner of the 
hallway intersection, heading toward 
Nova.
 They were being chased by a single 
man with a blaster, yelling like a 
berserker as he ran. The man?Nova 
saw that he was dressed like a down-
on-his-luck spacer?stopped, 
realizing that there were suddenly 
overwhelming odds in front of him. 
Then he turned and ran back the other 
way, putting on a burst of speed as he 
disappeared around the corner.
 "After him! Go!" Nova led the 
pursuit, followed by his squad and the 
others. Once around the bend, he saw 
that the fleeing spacer had been joined 
by a Wookiee, and both of them were 
now shooting back at their pursuers as 
they fled. They returned fire, but no 
one was hitting anything; the excited 
troopers were just spraying blasterfire.
 They wouldn't hit the two. He was 
sure of it. But how could he know 
that?
 They rounded a corner. "Close the 
blast doors!" somebody yelled.
 The heavy durasteel panels ahead 
began to iris shut, but the running 
man and the Wookiee managed to 
leap through before they closed 
completely.
 "Open the blast doors! Open the 
blast doors!" somebody was now 
shouting. It was almost comical. Since 
he was the closest, Nova reached for 
the controls.
 But in that moment, he hesitated. He 
knew?felt it in a way that he couldn't 
explain but also could not deny?that 
the man and the Wookiee they were 
after had to escape. That somehow it 
would be, as the old archivist had 
said, part of the solution and not part 
of the problem.
 How could he know this? Was it part 
of the connection to the Force that the 
doc had talked about? Nova didn't 
know ... it seemed crazy, but he had to 
acknowledge what he felt.
 One of the troopers said, "Sarge? 
You gonna open the doors?"
 "I'm trying. The switch is jammed." 
He moved his armored hand over the 
controls, pretending to try to move 
them, knowing that none of his men 
could see what he was doing.
 A few more seconds might make the 
difference. He could give them that 
much.
 "Still not working," Nova said. He 
activated his comlink. "Blast Control, 
this is Sergeant Stihl, operating 
number four-three-nine-five-seven-
zero-four-three-seven. I need an 
override on the blast doors, Level 
Five, Corridor Six. Open them."
 "Manual controls appear to be 
functional on all doors in that 
corridor," came back the reply 
through his helmet's commset.
 "And I'm telling you they aren't. You 
gonna open it or let the terrorists we're 
chasing escape?"
 "Acknowledged."
 The blast doors opened. "Let's go!" 
Nova said.
 Ahead, the corridor branched. Again, 
he could not say how he knew, but he 
was sure the fugitives had taken the 
turn to port.
 "Which way, Sarge?"
 "To the right," Nova said, and led 
the charge.
 There's your chance, friend, he 
thought. I hope you make good use of 
it.

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE DOCKING BAY 
2037, DEATH STAR
 
 There he was. After so much time 
and across so much space, the hooded 
figure of Obi-Wan Kenobi, his former 
Master and friend, stood right in front 
of him. He had aged; his face was 
lined, his beard white. It was 
impossible not to remember vividly 
the last time they had seen each other, 
when his Master had crippled him and 
left him to die on the fiery banks of a 
river of molten rock, light-years from 
here.
 Now his anger smoldered in him like 
the banks of that coursing stream of 
lava. You should have killed me then, 
Obi-Wan.
 Vader lit his lightsaber. The red 
beam crackled with power.
 Obi-Wan had already known Vader 
was there, of course. The Force 
swirled about the two of them, forging 
a link impossible to miss.
 Vader strode toward the old man. As 
he drew nearer, Obi-Wan ignited his 
own lightsaber. The blue gleam of the 
blade flashed brightly.
 "I've been waiting for you, Obi-Wan. 
We meet again, at last. The circle is 
now complete."
 Vader raised his weapon to attack, 
and Obi-Wan matched his pose.
 "When I left you, I was but the 
learner; now I am the Master."
 "Only a master of evil, Darth." With 
that, Obi-Wan stepped in and cut.
 Vader blocked the attack easily. Obi-
Wan attacked again, and again, Vader 
blocked each strike.
 If the old man thought he could rattle 
him by attacking instead of defending, 
he was mistaken. Vader riposted, sped 
up his timing, and took the initiative, 
forcing the erstwhile Jedi to defend.
 He still had some skill, his old 
Master did, but he was out of practice. 
Vader could feel it through the Force.
 Obi-Wan twirled and blocked a 
slash, then wove a defensive pattern 
with his blade. The Force was still 
with the old Jedi; he was able to 
anticipate Vader's strikes and block or 
parry them. But after a quick 
exchange, Vader felt the energy shift 
in his favor. "Your powers are weak, 
old man."
 There had always been in Vader a 
small bit of worry about this day. Not 
much; just a trace. He had been sure, 
in his youthful arrogance, that he had 
been stronger, had been better than 
the Jedi Knight who had been his 
teacher, and the memory of what Obi-
Wan had done to him would never be 
erased. He had been a superior fighter 
even when he had been Anakin 
Skywalker, and yet Obi-Wan had 
defeated him.
 Could he win now?
 It was as if the old man could read 
his thoughts:
 "You can't win, Darth. If you strike 
me down, I shall become more 
powerful than you can possibly 
imagine."
 Vader knew that Obi-Wan was 
taunting him by using the Sith 
honorific, but he would not allow 
himself to be baited. Obi-Wan lunged 
again, attacking, but Vader was ready. 
Their sabers clashed, sparks spewed, 
the stink of ozone wafted over them, 
but Vader stood his ground. The 
blades slid along each other's length, 
then stopped, bound together in the 
magnetic handle guards, the men 
face-to-face.
 Vader shoved, hard, and they broke 
the clash. Obi-Wan retreated a step.
 Vader felt the fierce anticipation of 
victory pound in his heart. "You 
should not have come back," he told 
the old Jedi.
 Another exchange?four, five, six 
attacks and blocks?and Vader knew 
the old man was weakening. The 
Force might be strong in Obi-Wan, 
but the dark side was stronger in 
Vader. It let him anticipate his 
adversary's strikes and counter them 
almost before they began.
 Obi-Wan knew it, too. He began a 
retreat, backing away, his lightsaber 
itself seeming weaker as he moved.
 Vader backed Obi-Wan past an open 
blast door leading to the forward dock 
where the Rebel freighter was being 
held under guard. The old man was 
obviously tiring.
 You're mine, old man, Vader 
thought.
 But just as he was ready to deliver 
the final strike, Obi-Wan managed a 
fast series of attacks, and Vader had 
to move quickly to avoid the strikes. 
Even as old and weak as Obi-Wan 
was, his technique was accomplished 
enough that a foolish move on Vader's 
part could still be fatal.
 A group of stormtroopers standing in 
the dock became aware of them. 
Vader felt rather than saw them notice 
the strange duel, and sensed the 
troopers heading toward them.
 He did not wish them to interfere, 
but even to warn them off would take 
concentration that he could not afford 
at the moment. Should his attention 
falter, Obi-Wan could kill him in the 
blink of an eye.
 Vader heard someone call from the 
dock: "Ben?" It was a young man's 
voice. Still he could not risk a look in 
that direction.
 But Obi-Wan glanced away, quickly, 
then looked back at Vader. Then he 
did the last thing Vader could have 
possibly imagined?
 He smiled.
 It was an expression not the least 
worried; almost beatific, in fact. Then, 
still smiling, Obi-Wan lifted his 
lightsaber so that the tip pointed 
straight up at the ceiling.
 The action was so totally unexpected 
that Vader paused for an instant in 
shock. Not even the Force had lent 
him prescience concerning this. His 
former Master had left himself wide 
open. Was it a trap?
 It didn't matter. If it was, Obi-Wan 
wasn't fast enough, or strong enough, 
to spring it in time. Vader shifted his 
lightsaber and cut from the right, 
hard, aiming for the neck?
 His lightsaber sheared through the 
old man as if the latter were no denser 
than the air itself, and Obi-Wan 
collapsed.
 Yes! Fierce, exultant joy coursed 
through the man who had been 
Anakin Skywalker. He had done it! 
He had slain Obi-Wan Kenobi! His 
revenge was complete!
 From a distance he heard someone 
scream "Nooo!"?a cry of utter 
despair. But Vader paid it no heed. 
The dark side surged within him as 
powerfully as he had ever felt it?for 
an instant. But then it stopped.
 What had just happened?
 Vader looked down at the body. But 
there was no body. Only Obi-Wan's 
robes and cloak.
 This was impossible! It could not be!
 The squad of stormtroopers began 
firing at somebody in the docking 
bay, but Vader could not be bothered 
to look. He stepped forward, stared 
down in disbelief. An illusion of some 
kind? Some Jedi mind trick that the 
old man had never imparted to him?
 Impossible! Obi-Wan had taught 
him everything Vader knew . . .
 But, whispered a voice from within, 
maybe not everything that Obi-Wan 
knew.
 Vader reached out with his boot to 
touch the corpse, but he only stirred 
the empty vestments, charred by the 
lightsaber's heat, with his questing 
foot.
 Obi-Wan Kenobi was gone.
 How could this be?
 For the first time that he could 
remember, the dark side had no 
answer. And a great surge of 
unfamiliar emotion suddenly washed 
over him.
 Darth Vader, the Dark Lord of the 
Sith's apprentice, one of the two most 
powerful beings in the galaxy, was 
afraid.

COMMAND CENTER, DEATH STAR
 
 Tarkin watched the recording of 
Vader fighting the old man in a 
lightsaber duel, fascinated. Obi-Wan 
Kenobi had survived all these years. 
Who would have believed it?
 That he was still able to make a fight 
of it against Darth Vader was even 
more impressive. The man looked old 
enough to be Vader's father, and then 
some. Amazing.
 The sound was not the best quality, 
but Tarkin could hear some of the 
exchanges between the two fighters. 
One statement from Kenobi in 
particular struck him, something 
about becoming more powerful than 
his ex-student could possibly imagine 
if Vader struck him down.
 How droll. Had Kenobi expected 
Vader to flee in superstitious terror by 
telling him such a thing?
 The thought had barely crossed 
Tarkin's mind, however, when 
moments later Vader did indeed strike 
the old man down, and the former
