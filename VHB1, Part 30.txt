I clicked on the safety of my gun and struggled into a seat belt. Phillip slumped down into the seat, long
legs spreadeagled on either side of the floorboard hump. His eyes were closed.
"Where to?" Willie asked.
Good question. I wanted to go home and go to sleep, but . . . "Phillip's face needs patching up."
"You wanna take him to a hospital?"

"I'm all right," Phillip said. His voice was low and strange.
"You aren't all right," I said.
He opened his eyes and turned to look at me. The blood had run down his neck, a dark, glistening
stream that shone in the flashes of the streetlights. "You were hurt a lot worse last night," he said.
I looked away from him, out the window. I didn't know what to say. "I'm all right now."
"I'll be all right, too."
I looked back at him. He was staring at me. I couldn't read the expression on his face, and wanted to.
"What are you thinking, Phillip?"
He turned his head to stare straight ahead. His face was all silhouette and shadows. "That I stood up to
the master. I did it. I did it!" His voice held a fierce warmth with the last. Fierce pride.
"You were very brave," I said.
"I was, wasn't I?"
I smiled and nodded. "Yes."
"I hate to interrupt you two, but I need to know where to drive this thing," Willie said.
"Drop me back at Guilty Pleasures," Phillip said.
"You should see a doc."
"They'll take care of me at the club."
"Ya sure?"
He nodded, then winced and turned to me. "You wanted to know who was giving me orders. It was
Nikolaos. You were right. That first day. She wanted me to seduce you." He smiled. It didn't look right
with the blood. "Guess I wasn't up to the job."
"Phillip. . ." I said.
"No, its all right. You were right about me. I'm sick. No wonder you didn't want me."
I glanced over at Willie. He was concentrating on his driving as if his life depended on it. Damn, he was
smarter dead than alive.
I took a deep breath and tried to decide what to say. "Phillip . . . The kiss before you . . . bit me." God,
how did I say this? "It was nice."
He glanced at me, quick, then away. "You mean that?"
"Yes."

An awkward silence stretched through the car. No sound but the rush of pavement under the wheels.
The night flashes of lights, and the isolating darkness.
"Standing up to Nikolaos tonight was one of the bravest things I've ever seen anybody do. Also one of
the stupidest," I said.
He laughed, abrupt and surprised.
"Don't ever do it again. I don't want your death on my hands."
"It was my choice," he said.
"No more heroics, okay?"
He glanced at me. "Would you be sorry if I died?"
"Yes."
"I guess that's something."
What did he want me to say? To confess undying love, or something silly like that? How about undying
lust? Either one would be a lie. What did he want from me? I almost asked him, but I didn't. I wasn't that
brave.
