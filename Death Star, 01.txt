 The alert siren screamed, a piercing 
wail that couldn't be ignored by any 
being on board with ears and a pulse. 
It had one thing to say, and it said it 
loud and clear:
 Scramble!
 Lieutenant Commander Villian "Vil" 
Dance came out of a deep sleep at the 
blaring alarm, sat up, and leapt from 
his rack to the expanded metal deck of 
the Ready Room quarters. Save for 
the helmet, he already wore his space 
suit, one of the first things an on-call 
TIE pilot learned to do was sleep in 
full battle gear. He ran for the door, 
half a step ahead of the next pilot to 
awaken. He grabbed his headgear, 
darted into the hall and turned to the 
right, then sprinted for the launching 
bay.
 It could be a drill; there had been 
plenty of those lately to keep the 
pilots on their toes. But maybe this 
time it wasn't. One could always 
hope.
 Vil ran into the assembly area. A-
grav on the flight deck was kept at 
slightly below one g, so that the 
pilots, all of whom were human or 
humanoid, could move a little faster 
and get to their stations a little sooner. 
The smell of launch lube was acrid in 
the cold air, and the pulsing lights 
painted the area in bright, primary 
flashes. Techs scrambled, getting the 
TIE fighters to final-set for takeoff, 
while pilots ran toward the craft. Vil 
noticed that it was just his squad 
being scrambled. Must not be a big 
problem, whatever it was.
 Command always said it didn't 
matter which unit you got. TIE 
fighters were all the same, down to 
the last nut and bolt, but even so, 
every pilot had his or her favorite 
ship. You weren't supposed to 
personalize them, of course, but there 
were ways to tell?a scratch here, a 
scuff mark there . . .  after a while, 
you got to where you knew which 
fighter was which. And no matter 
what Command said, some were 
better than others?a little faster, a 
little tighter in the turns, the laser 
cannons a hair quicker to fire when 
you touched the stud. Vil happened to 
know that his assigned ship this 
rotation was Black-11, one of his 
favorites. Maybe it was pure 
superstition, but he breathed just a 
little easier, knowing that particular 
craft had his name on it this time 
around.
 The command officer on deck, 
Captain Rax Exeter, waved Vil over.
 "Cap, what's up? Another drill?"
 "Negative, Lieutenant. A group of 
prisoners somehow managed to take 
over one of the new Lambda-class 
shuttles. They're trying to get far 
enough away to make the jump to 
hyperspace. That isn't going to happen 
on my watch. The ID codes and 
tracking will be in your fighter's 
computer. Don't let 'em get away, 
son."
 "No, sir. What about the crew?" Vil 
knew the new shuttles carried only a 
pilot and copilot.
 "Assumed dead. These are bad guys 
doing this, Dance?traitors and 
murderers. That's reason enough to 
cook them, but we do not want them 
getting away to tell anybody what the 
Empire is doing out here, do we?"
 "No, sir!"
 "Go, Lieutenant, go!"
 Vil nodded, not bothering to salute, 
then turned and ran. As he did, he put 
his helmet on and locked it into place. 
The hiss of air into his face was 
metallic and cool as the suit's system 
went online. It felt very comforting. 
The vac suit's extreme-temp-resistant 
weave of durasteel and plastoid, along 
with the polarizing densecris helmet, 
were the only things that would 
protect him from hard vacuum. Suit 
failure could make a strong man lose 
consciousness in under ten seconds, 
and die in under a minute. He'd seen it 
happen.
 TIE fighters, in order to save mass, 
had no defensive shield generators, no 
hyperdrive capability, and no 
emergency life-support systems. They 
were thus fragile, but fast, and that 
was fine with Vil. He'd rather dodge 
enemy fire than hope it would bounce 
off. There was no skill in piloting 
some lumbering chunk of durasteel; 
might as well be sitting with your feet 
up at a turbolaser console back on the 
ship. Where was the fun in that?
 The TIE tech had the hatch up on 
Black-11 as Vil arrived at the gantry 
above the ship. It was the work of an 
instant to clamber down and into the 
fighter's snug cockpit.
 The hatch came down and hissed 
shut. Vil touched the power-up stud, 
and the inside of the TIE?named for 
the twin ion engines that drove it?lit 
up. He scanned the controls with a 
quick and experienced eye. All 
systems were green.
 The tech raised his hand in question. 
Vil waved back. "Go!"
 "Copy that, ST-One-One. Prepare 
for insertion."
 Vil felt his lips twitch in annoyance. 
The Empire was determined to erase 
all signs of individuality in its pilots, 
on the absurd theory that nameless, 
faceless operators were somehow 
more effective. Thus the classification 
numbers, the anonymous flight suits 
and helmets, and the random rotation 
of spacecraft. The standardizing 
approach had worked reasonably well 
in the Clone Wars, but there was one 
important difference here: neither Vil 
nor any other TIE pilot that he knew 
of was a clone. None of the members 
of Alpha Squad had any intention of 
being reduced to automata. If that was 
what the Empire really wanted, let 
them use droid pilots and see how 
well that worked.
 His musing was interrupted by the 
small jolt of the cycling rack below 
the gantry kicking on. Vil's ship began 
to move toward the launching bay 
door. He saw the tech slip his own 
helmet on and lock it down.
 Already the bay pumps were 
working full blast, depressurizing the 
area. By the time the launch doors 
were open, the air would be cycled. 
Vil took a deep breath, readying 
himself for the heavy hand of g-force 
that would push him back into the seat 
when the engines hurled him forward.
 Launch Control's voice crackled in 
his headphones. "Alpha Squad 
Leader, stand by for launch."
 "Copy," Vil said. The launch doors 
pulled back with tantalizing slowness, 
the hydraulic thrum of their 
movement made audible by 
conduction through the floor and 
Black-11's frame.
 "You are go for launch in five, four, 
three, two . . .  go!"
 Outside the confines of the Star 
Destroyer, the vastness of space 
enveloped Lieutenant Vil Dance as 
the ion engines pushed the TIE past 
the last stray wisps of frozen air and 
into the infinite dark. He grinned. He 
always did. He couldn't help it.
 Back where I belong . . . 
 The flat blackness of space 
surrounded him. Behind him, he 
knew, the Steel Talon was seemingly 
shrinking as they pulled away from it. 
"Down" and to port was the curvature 
of the prison planet. Though they 
were in polar orbit, Despayre's axial 
tilt showed more of the night side than 
day. The dark hemisphere was mostly 
unrelieved blackness, with a few 
lonely lights here and there.
 Vil flicked his comm?though it 
came on automatically at launch, a 
good pilot always toggled it, just to be 
sure. "Alpha Squad, pyramid 
formation on me as soon as you are 
clear," he said. "Go to tactical channel 
five, that's tac-fiver, and log in."
 Vil switched his own comm channel 
to five. It was a lower-powered band 
with a shorter range, but that was the 
point?you didn't want the enemy 
overhearing you. And in some cases, 
it wasn't a good idea for the comm 
officer monitoring you back on the 
base ship to be privy to conversations, 
either. They tended to be a bit more 
informal than the Empire liked.
 There came a chorus of "Copy, 
Alpha Leader!" from the other eleven 
pilots in his squad as they switched 
over to the new channel.
 It took only a few seconds for the 
last fighter to launch, and only a few 
more for the squad to form behind 
Vil.
 "What's the drill, Vil?" That from 
Benjo, aka ST-1-2, his second in 
command and right panelman.
 "Alpha Squadron, we have a 
Lambda-class shuttle captured by 
prisoners. They are running for hyper. 
Either they give up and come back, or 
we dust 'em."
 "Lambda-class? That's one of the 
new ones, right? They have any 
guns?"
 Vil sighed. That was Raar Anyell, a 
Corellian like Vil himself, but not 
somebody you'd want to hold up as a 
prime example of the human species. 
"Don't you bother to read the boards 
at all, Anyell?"
 "I was just about to do that, sir, when 
the alarm went off. Was looking right 
at 'em. Had the latest notices right in 
my hand. Sir."
 The other pilots laughed, and even 
Vil had to grin. Anyell was a foul-up 
everywhere except in the cockpit, but 
he was a good enough pilot that Vil 
was willing to give him some slice.
 His sensor screen pinged, giving him 
an image of their quarry. He altered 
course to intercept.
 "Anybody else behind on his 
homework, listen up," he said. "The 
Lambda-class shuttle is twenty meters 
long, has a top speed of fourteen 
hundred g, a Class-One hyperdrive, 
and can carry twenty troops in full 
battle gear?probably a couple more 
convicts in civvies.
 "The ship carries three double-
blaster cannons and two double-laser 
cannons. It can't accelerate worth a 
wheep and it turns slower than a 
comet, but if you get in its sights, it 
can blow you to itty-bitty pieces. It 
would be embarrassing to have to 
inform your family you got shot apart 
by a shuttle, so stay alert."
 There came another chorus of 
acknowledgments:
 "Copy, sir."
 "Yes, sir!"
 "No sweat."
 "Anyell, I didn't hear your response."
 "Oh, sorry, sir, I was taking a little 
nap. What was the question?"
 Before the squad commander could 
reply, the shuttle suddenly loomed 
ahead. It was running as silently as 
possible, with no lights, but as its 
orbit brought it across the terminator 
and out of Despayre's night side, the 
sunlight struck rays from its hull.
 "There is our target, four kilometers 
dead ahead. I want a fast flyby so they 
can see us, and then I want a fountain 
pattern dispersal and loop, two klicks 
minimum distance and bracket, one, 
four, four, and two, you know who 
you are. I'll move in close and have a 
word with whoever they have flying 
the stolen spacecraft."
 Benjo: "Aw, Lieutenant, come on, 
let us have a shot, too."
 "Negative. If you had a clue about 
the vessel, I might, but since you're 
just as likely to shoot each other as 
the quarry, you'll hold the bracket."
 More acknowledgments, but without 
much enthusiasm. He couldn't blame 
his squad?they hadn't had any action 
except drills since they'd been 
assigned to this project?but his 
secondary goal was to bring all his 
men back alive. The primary, of 
course, was to accomplish their 
mission. He didn't need a squad for 
this; any fighter pilot worth his spit 
should be able to deal with a 
lumbering shuttle, even one with the 
new-vehicle smell still in it. The 
Lambda's delta vee wasn't all that 
efficient, but with constant drive it 
could get above the solar plane and 
far enough out of the planet's gravity 
well to engage its hyperdrive fairly 
soon?and once it was in the chute, 
they'd never find it.
 But that wasn't going to happen.
 The pyramid-shaped formation 
zipped past the fleeing shuttle, close 
enough for Vil to see the pilot sitting 
in the command seat. He didn't look 
surprised, of course?he would have 
seen them coming on the sensors. But 
he couldn't outrun them, couldn't 
dodge, and no way could he take out a 
full squad of TIE fighters even if he 
was the best gunner who'd ever lived, 
not in that boat. And anyway, Vil 
wasn't going to give him the 
opportunity to try.
 The squad flowered into the 
dispersal maneuver as ordered, 
looping out and away to their 
assigned positions, angled pressor 
beams in their arrays providing 
maneuverability. Vil pulled a high-g 
tight turn and came around to parallel 
the shuttle a few hundred meters 
away, slightly above it. He watched 
the wing turrets closely. As soon as 
they started to track him, he jinked to 
port, then to starboard, slowed, then 
sped up. They tried to keep up with 
him, but they were a hair too slow.
 Vil toggled to a wide-band channel. 
They'd hear this back in the 
Destroyer, he knew.
 "Attention, shuttle RLH-One. Turn 
the craft around and proceed 
immediately to Star Destroyer Steel 
Talon's tractor beam range."
 There was no answer; nothing but 
the slight hiss of the carrier.
 "Shuttle craft, do you copy my 
transmission?"
 Another pause. Then: "Yeah, we 
hear you, rocketjock. We aren't of a 
mind to do that."
 Vil looked at his control panel. They 
were two minutes away from 
Minimum Safe Distance?the point 
far enough from Despayre where they 
could safely attempt the jump to 
lightspeed. Jump too close to a 
planet's gravity well and the shift 
would tear the vessel apart. If the guy 
he was talking to had enough skill to 
fly the shuttle, he'd know that. His 
control panel would tell him when he 
reached MSD, and then it would be 
over. Lieutenant Dance would have 
failed a mission, for the first time.
 Never happen, he thought. "Turn it 
around, or we will fire," he said.
 "You'd do that? Just blow us apart? 
Essentially murder fifteen men?and 
two women? One of them is old 
enough to be your granny. You can 
live with that ?"
 He was stalling for time, Vil knew. 
The beings on that shuttle were bad 
enough to have been sent to the 
galaxy's number one prison planet, 
and the Imperial courts didn't bother 
to do that with petty thieves or traffic 
violators. His granny hadn't robbed 
any banks or killed anybody. Not that 
he knew of, anyway.
 "Shuttle pilot, I say again?"
 Vil saw the port turret on the shuttle 
open up. He cut across the craft's 
flight path, angling away aft as the 
starboard gun began firing. He hit his 
thrusters full, coming up in a half loop 
and twist away from the incoming 
laserfire.
 Even a good gunner couldn't have 
spiked him at this angle, and these 
guys weren't anywhere close to good 
enough. Still, the pulsed incandescent 
beams came close.
 "Lieutenant?!" That from Benjo.
 "Hold your position, Alpha Squad, 
there's no problem here." Cool and 
calm. Like discussing what they 
might be having for dinner.
 He zipped Black-11 out of range.
 The clock was running down. Less 
than a minute to MSD.
 "Last chance, shuttle. Turn it around. 
Now."
 In answer, the pilot pulled the shuttle 
topward so his gunners could get a 
better angle. They started shooting 
again.
 The shots were wild, but there was 
always a chance a stray beam could 
hit you, even by accident. And 
wouldn't that be a glorious end to an 
unblemished career? To be killed by a 
convict on a milking shuttle?
 Enough of this. Vil hit the drive 
controls and damped the thrust to 
zero. Then he pushed the throttles to 
full, angled to port and topside, did a 
roll and loop, and came around, 
driving at the shuttle amidships.
 He pressed the fire-control button.
 Black-11 spat twin laser bolts from 
the low-temp tips?blip-blip, blip-
blip, blip-blip?
 Vil Dance was a better-than-average 
shooter. The bolts ripped into the 
shuttle, chewed it up, and as he 
overflew and peeled away to 
starboard-downside, the Lambda blew 
apart, shattering into at least half a 
dozen large pieces and hundreds of 
smaller ones amid a cloud of flash-
frozen air, liquid, and debris.
 And pin wheeling bodies.
 Vil switched back to tac-five. 
"Anyell, Lude, move in and check for 
survivors." He kept his voice calm, 
emotionless, no big deal. His pulse 
was racing, but they didn't have to 
know that. Let them think his heart 
pumped liquid oxy.
 "None of 'em were wearing suits, 
Lieutenant," Lude said a moment 
later. "No survivors. Too bad about 
that brand-new ship."
 "Good hit, Vil," Benjo said. 
"Congratulations."
 Vil felt a warm glow of satisfaction. 
It had been a good hit. And they had 
been firing at him, so it wasn't like 
shooting yorks in a canister. It had 
been a righteous response.
 He switched back to the main op-
chan. "Fighter Control, this is ST-
One-One, Lieutenant Vil Dance of 
TIE fighter Alpha Squadron. Mission 
accomplished. You might want to 
send out a recovery vessel to pick up 
the pieces."
 "Copy, ST-One-One," said Captain 
Exeter. "Good job."
 "Thank you, sir. Let's return to base, 
Alpha Squad."
 Vil smiled as he waited for his team 
to form up again. This was the best 
job in the galaxy, being a fighter pilot. 
He couldn't imagine a better one. He 
was young, not even twenty-five yet, 
and already a legend among his 
peers?and among the ladies as well. 
Life was good.
 As they started for the Destroyer, Vil 
saw in the distance the frame of the 
gigantic battle station that was being 
built in planetary orbit. They were a 
hundred kilometers away from the 
structure, and it was still skeletal, its 
interior construction only just begun, 
but even so, it looked impossibly huge 
at this distance. It was to be the size 
of a small moon when it was finished, 
dwarfing the largest Star Destroyer.
 Incredible to think about. And if he 
kept racking up missions like the one 
just completed, there was a very good 
chance that he would be assigned as 
unit commander on board the new 
station.
 He led his squad back to the 
equatorial launching bay. Looking at 
the awe-inspiring base, he felt a surge 
of pride in the Empire, and a feeling 
of gratitude at being a part of the 
Tarkin Doctrine's glorious mission. 
There was no official appellation or 
designation, other than battle station, 
that he knew of for the Grand Moff's 
vision, but there was a name for it that 
everybody he knew, officers and 
enlisted alike, used.
 They called it the Death Star.

LQ FLAGSHIP HAVELON, IN 
GEOSYNCHRONOUS ORBIT ABOVE 
PLANET DESPAYRE
 
 Wilhuff Tarkin?now Grand Moff 
Tarkin, with that exalted promotion 
being due to this very project?stood 
before the deck-to-ceiling 
transparisteel viewport on the 
observation deck, looked out at his 
creation, and found it good.
 He was building a world.
 True, as worlds went, what was 
taking form three hundred kilometers 
from his flagship would not be quite 
as imposing as Imperial Center, say, 
or Alderaan. But when finished, it 
would be larger than two of the 
satellites of his own planet Eriadu, 
and it would be home to well over a 
million beings.
 More to the point, it would hold 
countless worlds under its?his? 
thrall.
 It had been nearly three decades 
since Raith Sienar had first made 
Tarkin privy to the concept of the 
"battle station planetoid," and it had 
taken almost a decade to get the idea 
through the snarls of red tape and 
bring the Geonosians on board to 
improve and implement the designs. 
The project had been known by 
various code names?such as the 
Great Weapon?and the original 
plans had been much improved by the 
Geonosian leader Poggle the Lesser. 
But it had taken years for the concept 
to be stewarded through the tortuous 
maze of government bureaucracy 
before construction was finally 
ordered to begin. There were still 
flaws in the original plans, but many 
of them had been addressed during 
the building of the proof-of-concept 
prototype in the Maw Installation, and 
others were being corrected as they 
were uncovered. The greatest minds 
in the galaxy had been recruited or 
drafted to lend their expertise to the 
building of this ultimate weapon. The 
brilliant Dr. Ohran Keldor, the mad 
weapons master Umak Leth, the 
young but nevertheless laser-sharp 
Omwati prodigy Qwi Xux, the 
Twi'lek administrator Tol Sivron?
they, and many, many others of like 
stripe, had been investigated and 
approved by Tarkin himself. All were 
as good as the Empire could provide, 
willing or unwilling.
 In addition, he had conscripted a 
veritable army of enslaved Wookiees, 
plus tens of thousands of convicts 
from the steaming jungles of the 
prison planet Despayre, and a plethora 
of construction droids, the latter the 
largest such collection of automata 
ever assembled. All of them, organic 
and artificial, now worked around the 
chrono, with but one goal in mind: the 
culmination of his vision.
 The project code-named Death Star.
 Tarkin pursed his lips slightly. There 
was a taint of melodrama to the name 
that he didn't care for, but no matter. 
The words, along with the reality of 
the battle station itself, would amply 
convey its terrifying purpose.
 The Horuz system had been 
scavenged for raw material; asteroids 
and comets were being harvested 
from both the inner and outer belts 
and broken into components of 
oxygen, hydrogen, iron, nickel, and 
other elements; enormous bulk 
transports, ore haulers, tankers, and 
cargo craft had been gutted and 
reconfigured as orbiting laboratories, 
factories, and housing, all filled with 
workers producing fiber optics, 
electronics, and thousands of other 
technological instruments and 
construction materials. After nearly 
two decades of frustration, of false 
starts, union disputes, administrative 
procedure, and political maneuvering, 
the construction of the Empire's 
doomsday device was at last 
irrevocably under way.
 Certainly there had been problems. 
Tarkin had been surprised and 
annoyed to find that Raith Sienar's 
original designs?the very same ones 
he himself had presented to Palpatine, 
and which the Emperor had rejected 
more than ten years earlier?had been 
the basis for the plans
 Palpatine had finally given him to 
implement. Well, perhaps it wasn't so 
surprising, given the vagaries of war 
and politics. Nothing that went into 
the Empire's vaults was ever 
completely lost, although sometimes 
things were mislaid. And concepts 
rejected when they came from 
someone else often looked better 
when rethought as one's own. Even 
the Emperor, it seemed, was not 
immune to that particular hubris.
 After a prototype design had been 
built and refined in the heart of the 
swarm of black holes known as the 
Maw cluster, Tarkin and Bevel 
Lemelisk, the head of design, had had 
the Death Star project moved several 
times to avoid possible Rebel 
sabotage attempts, ultimately 
relocating it to the Horuz system for 
added security. Of course, on a 
project this huge, there was little hope 
that it could be kept secret forever?
but knowing that it existed, even 
knowing where it was being built, was 
not the same as being able to do 
anything about it. Admiral Daala, 
commanding four Imperial-class Star 
Destroyers and countless smaller 
attack craft, kept constant vigilance 
from her station within the Maw; any 
unauthorized ships that entered the 
region would not leave to carry tales 
elsewhere.
 Tarkin stared at the incomplete 
spheroid, floating serenely in the void, 
eerily backlit by the solar glow 
reflected from Despayre. It wasn't 
even a complete skeleton yet. When 
done, however, the battle station 
would be 160 kilometers in diameter. 
There would be twenty-four zones, 
twelve in each hemisphere. Every 
zone, called a sprawl, would have its 
own food replicators, hangar bays, 
hydroponics, detention blocks, 
medical centers, armories, command 
centers, and every other facility 
needed to provide service for any 
mission deemed necessary. In an 
emergency, auxiliary command 
centers located in each sprawl 
provided full weapons and 
maneuverability control, for a 
redundancy depth of twice a dozen. 
When fully operational, the battle 
station would be the most powerful 
force in the galaxy, by far.
 And it was Tarkin's to command.
 As the commander of such a vessel, 
he would, perforce, be the most 
powerful man in the galaxy. The 
thought had certainly occurred to him 
that not even the Emperor could stand 
before him, did he choose to 
challenge Palpatine's rule. Then again, 
Tarkin knew the Emperor. If their 
positions were reversed, he knew that 
there was no possible way he would 
sanction anyone having such power?
not without some kind of fail-safe. 
Was a destruct device already built 
into the station somewhere, with the 
red button safely installed in 
Palpatine's chambers? Was some 
equivalent of Order 66 known only to 
certain onboard officers and troops? 
Or was it something even more 
devious? Tarkin was certain the 
Emperor had some kind of insurance 
against any theoretical rebellion. Not 
that the Grand Moff intended such a 
course; he wasn't a foolish or suicidal 
man.
 Aside from the fearsome, world-
destroying "superlaser" itself?which 
was based upon the Hammertong 
Project and used a power source 
secretly taken by the 501st 
Stormtrooper Legion on Mygeeto 
during the Clone Wars?the station 
would mount a complement of craft, 
both space and ground, equal to a 
large planetside base: four capital 
ships, a hundred TIE/In starfighters, 
plus assault shuttles, blastboats, drop 
ships, support craft, and land vehicles, 
all ultimately totaling in the tens of 
thousands. It would have an 
operational crew numbering more 
than a quarter million, including 
nearly sixty thousand gunners alone. 
The vessel could easily transport more 
than half a million fully outfitted 
troops, and the support staff?pilots, 
crew, and other workers?would be 
half that number. The logistics of it all 
were staggering. Oh, it would be a 
fearsome monster indeed. But a 
monster tamed and under Tarkin's 
control; a monster sheathed in 
quadanium steel plating, invulnerable 
and impervious.
 Well, almost invulnerable. Lemelisk 
had disappointed him in that instance. 
The greatest challenge in designing 
the battle station, he had said, was not 
creating a beam cannon big enough to 
destroy a planet, nor was it building a 
moon-sized station that would be 
driven by a Class Three hyperdrive.
