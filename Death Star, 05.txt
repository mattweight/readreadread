wasn't a combat situation, like so 
many in the past had been. 
Nevertheless, he could feel a tiny 
worm of uneasiness begin to writhe 
slowly in his gut. "All right," he said.
 "Thought you'd say that?not like 
you have much of a choice. Pack your 
gear?you leave on the third-shift 
shuttle."
 As Uli headed for his quarters to 
gather his few belongings, he 
considered his life yet again. It had 
been two decades since his first 
assignment on Drongar. He'd helped 
staff a few more Rimsoos since then, 
and when the Clone Wars had ended 
he'd been more than ready to practice 
in the private sector. But that wasn't 
the life he'd been dealt. And now, 
when he should have been long free 
of his bondage, he was going to yet 
another post?this time on the 
behemoth called the Death Star.
 Generally he tried not to think about 
Drongar?even after all this time, 
reminiscing led to certain memories 
that were too painful. But he couldn't 
help but remember a phrase that the 
scrappy little Sullustan reporter Den 
Dhur had often used: I've got a bad 
feeling about this.
 Right, Uli thought.



SLASHTOWN PRISON COLONY, 
DESPAYRE
 
 Ratua first heard the rumor from 
Balahteez, the Pho Ph'eahian spice 
smuggler. Balahteez had, over the 
years, developed numerous contacts, 
and, perhaps not surprisingly, many of 
them had ended up here. As a result, 
he always seemed to have good 
sources of information. The
 price you had to pay to hear that 
information was to listen to his sad 
story of unjust treatment by the 
heartless Empire.
 Spice smuggling by itself usually 
wasn't enough to rate a trip to the 
prison planet for a life sentence, but 
Balahteez had been involved in an 
unfortunate accident while being 
pursued by an Imperial patrol near the 
Zharan moon Gall. Realizing that his 
ship would soon be overtaken by the 
navy gunboat chasing him, Balahteez 
had jettisoned his illegal cargo. The 
drug, packed securely in a block of 
carbonite the size of a luggage trunk, 
had hurtled down Gall's gravity well 
and punched a large hole into the 
outer hull of a barracks housing a 
large unit of TIE fighter mechanics. 
The hole was big enough that thirty of 
the hapless mechanics had been 
blown through it and into vacuum by 
the explosive decompression, and a 
dozen more had run out of air before 
the emergency and repair droids could 
reseal the compartment. Not to 
mention the other fifty or so who had 
died immediately from the impact; the 
carbonite block had been traveling at 
about two kilometers a second and 
had left a crater thirty meters in 
diameter.
 It had been an accident, pure and 
simple, and the odds against the block 
striking one structure in a few 
thousand square kilometers of utter 
emptiness were so large that 
calculating them would have caused a 
throbbing headache in a Givin. 
Needless to say, the Empire hadn't 
seen it like that.
 Ratua had heard the story enough 
times that he knew it almost word for 
word: the smuggler had been tried, 
convicted, and put on a ship to 
Despayre, all in less than a standard 
week's time. Ratua had heard it said 
that Pho Ph'eahians were great 
raconteurs, entertaining enough to 
keep their audience spellbound. And 
the Pho's story had been interesting?
the first five or six times Ratua had 
heard it. But he'd lost count of how 
many times it had been told to him by 
now. And the Pho couldn't be hurried 
along: Ratua had to sit and smile and 
pretend to be interested, offering 
sympathy in the right places, nodding, 
clucking his tongue and shaking his 
head in amazement, or the smuggler 
would get miffed and wouldn't reveal 
what he had recently learned. It was 
rather like performing a well-
rehearsed play: if Ratua did his part 
correctly, he'd be rewarded; flub his 
lines, and he'd be left joyless.
 "Truly, truly, you have been 
mistreated," he said. "So unfair."
 Balahteez nodded. "I have, indeed I 
have."
 "Sad. There is no justice." Ratua 
judged that they were at the point 
where he could now ask, "So, any 
news?"
 "As it happens, my leafy friend, yes. 
I have it on dependable authority that 
the EngSat Complex and Dybersyne 
Engineering Systems have begun 
production on the largest focusing 
magnet ever built?the gauss 
equivalent of a small iron moon's 
field, so they say."
 "Well, that's, uh . . .  interesting," 
Ratua said. "Probably the most 
exciting thing this year at the 
Interstellar Conference of Dull and 
Boring Science Twits."
 "My apologies for any inadvertent 
rudeness, my young sprout, but you 
know naught about which you jest." 
Balahteez glanced up at the ceiling 
but was clearly intending that his gaze 
pierce the roof and extend into space.
 "Yon construction, upon which so 
many of our fellows have been 
conscripted to menial labor, along 
with thousands and thousands of 
slaves, droids, and private contractors, 
not to mention army, navy, and 
Imperial engineers, is the destination 
for this colossal apparatus."
 "Yeah?so?"
 "Well, let me enlighten you. Beams 
of coherent particles, such as 
electrons, positrons, and the like, as 
well as amplified photon emissions, 
are often focused with large magnetic 
rings. Let us postulate that one could, 
in this fashion, generate a weaponized 
beam with enough force to blow a 
large asteroid apart with a single 
blast."
 "Is there such a thing?"
 "In theory, yes, though it requires a 
power source so large as to be 
impractical to perambulate, even on a 
Star Destroyer. But," Balahteez 
continued, raising one phalange in 
emphasis, "aboard something the size 
of, say, a moon, one could easily 
install and house such a mechanism."
 "You're saying the battle station 
they're building up there is going to be 
that large?"
 "Oh, my, yes. Easily. But this is not 
the point. The magnetic ring being 
built by Dybersyne is much, much 
larger than would be needed to focus 
such a beam, even a beam of such 
astonishing power."
 Ratua frowned. "You've lost me."
 The smuggler smiled. "Let us say, 
for the sake of argument, that the 
battle station under construction is 
large enough to hold, oh, six or eight 
such weapons, as well as a 
hypermatter reactor that could power 
a small planet. And that it is possible 
to focus all of this energy into a single 
beam?by the largest and most 
powerful magnetic ring ever made." 
He looked expectantly at Ratua.
 "Milking mopak," Ratua said softly.
 "Indeed, indeed. I see you 
comprehend at last. Not so dull and 
boring after all, eh?"
 Ratua shook his head. That was for 
sure. If the Empire could make 
something like that work, there 
wouldn't be any place a Rebel force 
could hide?the superweapon could, 
with a single blast, destroy whole 
continents. Maybe even whole 
planets. Just knowing such a thing 
existed, it seemed, would be enough 
to keep the peace. You certainly 
wouldn't want to see it coming into 
your system with malign intent . . . 
 Ratua was not the political type. 
He'd never cared much who was in 
charge, since he lived on the fringes 
anyhow, and now that he was 
condemned to spend the rest of his 
life on this dreadful planet, it mattered 
even less. If the Rebels somehow won 
out against the Empire?a thing that 
seemed beyond possibility, especially 
given this latest news?they wouldn't 
be likely to offer him amnesty for his 
crimes any more than the Empire had. 
Sure, there were some political 
prisoners here who might be freed, 
but thieves and smugglers and 
murderers wouldn't be going 
anywhere no matter who won the war. 
Even those who had truly been 
unjustly convicted, as he and 
Balahteez had been, couldn't expect 
commutation. No, he was doomed, it 
seemed, to rot here on Despayre for 
the remainder of his days.
 But . . . 
 If he could somehow manage to 
secure a spot on that station, he could 
be reasonably certain of two things: 
one, it wouldn't be hanging around the 
Horuz system very long after it was 
operational, and two, it would be one 
of the safest places in all the galaxy. 
All things considered, there would be 
a much better place to be than here.
 Unfortunately, Ratua had no 
particular talents that would make an 
Imperial recruiter want to choose him 
for station-side duty. Probably the 
Empire had little need of a scrounger 
on such a vessel. Still, when you 
considered it, on a station the size of a 
planetoid, a single being could easily 
escape official notice. Once there, he 
could fade into the shadows and, with 
a bit of luck, become effectively 
invisible. There had to be literally 
millions of places to hide up there.
 The problem was, up there might as 
well mean the other side of the 
galaxy, as long as he was down here. 
Still, it might not be an 
insurmountable problem . . . 
 "Let me get you a mug of tea," Ratua 
said, "and we can continue our talk."

IMPERIAL-CLASS STAR DESTROYER 
DEVASTATOR
 
 Refreshed from his time in the 
hyperbaric chamber, Darth Vader 
once more contemplated his unique 
fate. He had become accustomed to 
what he was, for the most part. It was 
hard, after all these years, to even 
visualize the face of Anakin 
Skywalker, Jedi Knight. But that was 
as it should be. Skywalker was dead. 
He'd been killed on the bank of one of 
the lava rivers of Mustafar, and the 
Sith Lord Darth Vader had risen from 
his ashes.
 He became once again aware of his 
breathing, and the demand-respirator 
sped up as he let the dark side take 
him, let it envelop him in anger and 
hatred. The power of the Force flowed 
into him, filling him, fueling his rage. 
It was, as always, his choice: he could 
absorb the dark energy, keep it pent 
within him, a no-longer-quite-human 
capacitor that could discharge it 
anytime, directing it toward anyone or 
anything. Or he could let it flow 
through him now, be not the vessel 
but the conduit, and thereby find 
momentary surcease from the fury 
that was always so much a part of 
him.
 He decided on the latter.
 He left his lightsaber clipped to his 
belt. Ordinarily he would have used it 
to practice on the dueling droids that 
had been specially designed and 
constructed to test his mettle. 
Programmed with the knowledge and 
skills of a dozen different martial 
artists, and armed with deadly cutting 
or impact weapons, they were 
formidable opponents indeed, and had 
been an integral part of Sith training 
since time immemorial. But not 
everything was about the lightsaber. 
There were other attributes, other 
weapons in his arsenal, that needed 
exercising as well.
 Vader inhaled, holding the dry and 
slightly bitter air for as long as his 
scarred lungs could manage it. When 
he allowed the breath to be drawn 
from him by the respirator, he thrust 
his right hand toward a nearby mirror.
 The aluminized densecris shattered 
into a thousand pieces, struck by the 
dark side as if by a metal fist.
 Vader was aware of the 
"unbreakable" substance splintering 
and falling, tinkling onto the floor, 
myriad reflections sparkling in the 
light as they seemed to move in slow 
motion. At the same time, the Force 
alerted him to the presence of 
someone in the doorway behind him.
 "Yes?" he said, without turning to 
look. He knew who it was by the 
greasy feel of the man's thoughts. Had 
he been unable to sense those, the 
mere fact that the intruder had come 
here to interrupt his exercises would 
have been enough to reveal his 
identity. No one else would dare.
 "My lord," said Admiral Motti. 
"Grand Moff Tarkin requests a word 
with you."
 Vader turned, surprised. Why would 
Tarkin seek an audience now? Yes, 
the man knew he was on the way to 
the construction site, but it was bad 
protocol to break comm silence.
 Whatever the ostensible reason, it 
was a certainty that a hidden agenda 
lay behind it. Tarkin's deviousness 
could flummox a roomful of 
Neimoidian barristers, Vader 
reflected. Fortunately, the Force was a 
most useful tool against such intrigue.
 Without a word, Vader swept past 
the admiral and headed for the 
privacy of his quarters. Motti's mind 
was not weak, but the emotions 
roiling beneath the calm exterior 
made his thoughts easy enough to 
sense: could he have struck Vader 
dead in that moment, he would have. 
The man's mind was a cauldron of 
seething anger, of hatred and envy, 
most of which was directed toward 
Vader. A pity Motti had no 
connection to the Force, the Dark 
Lord mused. He could have proved 
most useful.
 
 
 
 "Lord Vader," the holo of Tarkin 
said. The greeting and the slight bow 
with it were stiff and formal. The 
image was full-sized, if a bit 
transparent and fuzzy, occupying the 
holoplate in Vader's anteroom as if 
the governor were standing before 
him.
 Vader studied the simulacrum. 
Whatever the issue was that had 
prompted Tarkin to call, it wasn't a 
small one. The man's face was even 
more dour and saturnine than usual.
 "Grand Moff Tarkin," Vader said. 
He made no effort to disguise an edge 
of contempt for the title. The military 
did love its pecking order.
 Tarkin wasn't a man to dally with 
pleasantries; he got straight to the 
point. "There has been an explosion 
on the battle station?sabotage. 
Significant damage."
 "And . . . ?"
 "We have determined several 
suspects in its cause."
 "And . . . ?"
 "Our medical teams have not yet 
received the first supply shipment of 
mind-probes."
 Vader nodded. "I see. You wish me 
to examine these suspects."
 "Yes. If there are any preparations 
you need to make, speed is of the 
essence. It is paramount that we 
determine who caused this incident, 
and why, and deal with it forcefully."
 "I need no preparations. My ship 
will arrive in a few hours. I shall 
speak to the prisoners as soon as I 
board your vessel. Have them ready. I 
will determine who among them are 
responsible."
 Tarkin gave him another crisp 
military nod. "We look forward to 
your visit, Lord Vader."
 Vader gestured for the comm unit to 
disconnect without responding. Yes, 
he thought. I'm sure you do.
 This was most interesting news. If 
the Rebel Alliance was responsible?
and who else could it be??this action 
certainly gave the lie to the official 
image of the dissidents as 
disorganized rabble posing no real 
threat. Vader felt a small ember of 
satisfaction glow within him. He had 
known for some time that the 
malcontents were growing both in 
organization and in power. They had 
staged guerrilla raids on space stations 
and supply depots, had managed to 
obtain military materiel and warcraft 
from sympathetic industrial and 
shipyard designers, and had allied 
themselves with many alien species, 
playing upon the latters' resentment at 
being reduced to inferior status in the 
eyes of the New Order. They were 
more than just a motley collection of 
wild-eyed idealists; they now 
numbered among their ranks former 
Imperial strategists, programmers, and 
technicians, and their network of spies 
was growing more intricate daily. 
They were scum, true enough, but 
enough scum could clog any system, 
even one as complex and pristine as 
the Empire.
 They had to be dealt with, and they 
would be. This Death Star of Tarkin's 
could be effective to a degree, but one 
need not use a proton torpedo to swat 
a fire gnat.
 Vader turned and left his chambers. 
The dark side would tell him who the 
miscreants were?tell him, and deal 
with them as well.

THE SOFT HEART CANTINA, SOUTHERN 
UNDERGROUND, GRID 19, IMPERIAL 
CITY
 
 Memah Roothes frowned at the 
delivery droid. Local weather systems 
were acting up, and the air was hot, 
too moist, and cloying, not to mention 
smelling of lube and a hint of rotting 
garbage drifting through from the 
alley behind her cantina. She had been 
up late and arisen early, she already 
felt lousy, and she certainly didn't 
need this latest piece of bad news.
 "Excuse me? I don't think I heard 
you correctly. Please repeat that." The 
droid, a standard loader/unloader 
utility model, said again, "Your liquor 
shipment has been delayed. Our 
dispatcher tenders apologies for the 
mistake."
 "And what are my customers 
supposed to drink in the meanwhile? 
Water?"
 The droid's basic intelligence was 
sufficient for making liquor 
deliveries; it wasn't up to sarcasm. 
"Water is drinkable by all sentient 
carbon-based beings."
 "Yes, and even here it is free from 
any Imperial tap." The droid did not 
respond to that. Memah shook her 
head in disgust; a human mannerism 
she'd picked up. It was pointless to 
argue with a droid; might as well 
argue with the ferment dispensers 
under the bar. "All right. When may I 
expect the shipment?"
 "Tomorrow."
 "Well, I guess I'll just have to make 
do somehow, won't I?"
 That question was evidently also 
beyond the droid's comprehension. 
Sighing, Memah waved it away.
 Rodo, who had been in the front 
repairing a broken hinge caused by 
the impact of a combative patron, 
came back to the delivery portal. 
"Problem?"
 "Yes. Today's delivery?there isn't 
one."
 "Hmm . . . "
 Memah turned to look at him. "Do I 
detect some kind of meaning in that 
monosyllable?"
 "It's probably nothing," Rodo 
replied. "But I saw the food staples 
airtruck fan past Kenloo's Market this 
morning without stopping. They get 
their deliveries same days we do."
 The market was two buildings down, 
on the other side of a vacant shop that 
had once housed exotic offworld pets. 
Some kind of exobiotic plague had 
run through the animal stock seven 
months back, and half of them had 
died. The Empire had quarantined the 
place, had the remaining creatures put 
down, and that was the end of that. 
The building had sat empty ever 
since.
 She pulled herself back to Rodo's 
comment. "What are you getting at?"
 The big man shrugged. "Just seems 
odd that two businesses right next to 
each other, with service from different 
delivery companies, would both get 
bypassed on the same day."
 "A coincidence," she said.
 "When I was with the Strikebirds, 
we had a saying: Coincidence can get 
you killed." Rodo yawned and 
stretched his arms over his head, 
displaying muscles that would make a 
Whiphid look scrawny. "Maybe I'll 
check around," he said, "see if 
Chunte's and Ligabow's are also 
having delivery problems."
 "And if they are?"
 He shrugged. "Then it means 
something."
 She couldn't help the exasperated 
tone that crept into her voice. "Like 
what?"
 Rodo shrugged again. "Dunno. 
Could be a lot of things. Maybe just 
problems with dispatcher programs. 
Maybe the start of somebody trying to 
depress real estate values so he can 
buy up the block. Hard to say. Could 
be nothing at all."
 Memah nodded slowly, not quite 
sure what to make of Rodo's sudden 
and studied casualness. "Yeah, well, 
we're going to have to dust off some 
of the reserve stock to get through 
tonight's crowd. And even then, it'll 
be iffy."
 He nodded. "I'll be back before the 
evening crush," he said. He headed 
for the mouth of the alley, and she 
went back inside.
 Rodo's worry aside, a missed 
delivery was probably nothing to be 
concerned about, Memah told herself. 
There was, after all, a war on, and 
little glitches were to be expected, 
even if the war never actually came 
close to this planet, save for a few 
incidences of sabotage. And what 
Rebel with half a brain was going to 
come down to the Southern 
Underground to blow something up?
here, where there was a good chance 
somebody would waylay him and 
steal everything he had on him, 
including his bomb? Unless you knew 
your way around these parts, it was 
risky being a tourist without a couple 
of armed guards. Plus, there weren't 
any targets down here that would 
make much of a headline in the 
holocasts?who cared about the slums 
below the streets anyhow?
 She thought then of those Eyes 
who'd been in the other night. Yeah, 
okay, that had been unusual, but 
whatever their reasons, it wasn't as if 
there was anything covert going on . . 
. 
 Was it?
 Memah snorted. Probably some 
computer had burped somewhere and 
lost a couple of routing files. As long 
as it was a onetime glitch, she could 
live with that. After all, where local 
government was concerned, it wasn't 
as if she had a lot of choice these 
days.
 
 
 
 NCO CANTINA, ISD STEEL TALON
 
 The NCO cantina was half full, the 
air blowers working hard to get rid of 
the smoke and body odors, and almost 
succeeding. MCPO Tenn Graneet sat 
across the four-person table from 
Olzal Erne, the second-watch chief 
from the starboard array. Both 
humans had their elbows on the table, 
right hands clasped in arm-wrestling 
position. Their left hands were linked 
on the tabletop.
 Erne was bigger?twelve, maybe 
fifteen kilos heavier?ten years 
younger, and he liked to pump iron, 
so he had the muscles of a weight 
lifter. To look at them, it should be no 
contest?Erne clearly had the 
advantage.
 "You about ready, old man?" Erne 
said.
 "Just a second." Tenn freed his left 
hand, grabbed his frosted mug, and 
took a long swallow of ferment. He 
put the mug down, grinned, and 
relinked with Erne's left hand. "Good 
when you are, Olzal."
 A dozen members of both gunnery 
crews and a couple of deck polishers 
stood around the table, watching as 
both men settled in, the muscles on 
their arms beginning to bunch 
slightly. Other than that, the clasped 
hands could have been molded in 
durasteel.
 "Five on Chief Erne, thirty seconds 
max," one of Erne's gunners said.
 "I got that," somebody on Tenn's 
crew said.
 "Ten on CPO Graneet," one of the 
proton railers, also of Tenn's crew, 
chimed in.
 "Time on that?" a woman asked.
 "As long as it takes."
 "I'll take that bet."
 "Hey, Numbers, how much does our 
side win?" Tenn asked.
 Numbers was a Givin, a species of 
beings who were, on the whole, 
obsessed with mathematics. Only a 
few dozen Givins had been 
conscripted, but their ability to 
survive for short periods, unsuited, in 
hard vacuum, even more than their 
aptitude for juggling integers, had 
resulted in more favored treatment 
than most other nonhumanoids got 
from the Empire.
 Numbers had an uncanny ability to 
do all manner of arithmetic in his 
head, almost as fast as a droid. Now 
was no exception. Tenn had no sooner 
posed the question than the gaunt 
creature replied, "Eighty-five credits 
among us. Twenty in your pocket."
 "Counting your money, Tenn? You 
gotta beat me first, don't you?"
 "Oh, that." With a quick snap of his 
wrist and flexion of his chest and 
shoulders, Tenn slammed Erne's hand 
to the tabletop. It took maybe an 
entire second.
 He let go of the other man's hand to 
a smattering of applause and cheers. 
Erne looked stunned. He rubbed his 
biceps. "Milking son of a tairn!" he 
said. "How the kark did you do that?"
 Tenn grinned. "Clean living, Chief."
 The truth was otherwise, but only he 
knew it. Back in a dustup during the 
final days of the Clone Wars, when 
he'd been an assistant gunner on his 
first assignment, some idiot of a 
loader had switched leads on a heavy 
capacitor and then forgotten to set the 
safeties. As soon as the discharger 
opened it, the cap had blown and 
showered the gun crew with shrapnel, 
a piece of which had severed the 
tendon connecting Tenn's right 
pectoral muscle to his arm.
 It had been lucky for the loader that 
he'd been killed instantly; otherwise, 
those of the crew who weren't already 
maimed or dead would have made it a 
point to see him die slowly.
 When the medic had reconnected the 
tendon in Tenn's upper body, he 
hadn't liked the old attachment, which 
had gotten pretty banged up by the 
piece of hot metal. So he'd done an 
organic-screw embed and reattached 
the ligament a little lower. It looked 
fine, and eventually the screw was 
reabsorbed, leaving nothing more than 
a tiny bone nub. The result of this 
creative endeavor had been about a 25 
or 30 percent improvement on the 
leverage in his right arm. With a little 
training, Tenn's right pectoral was 
effectively almost half again as strong 
as his left. It didn't look it, it wasn't 
any larger, but the result was 
nonetheless impressive. It had won 
him a lot of bar bets on arm-wrestling 
contests over the years.
 Numbers slid a little stack of credits 
under Tenn's mug. "Your cut, Chief."
 "My elderly mother thanks you 
kindly, son." He looked at Erne. "So, I 
buy the next round?"
 "Works for me," the bigger man 
said.
 "No dishonor in being beaten by the 
best."
 The chief grinned. "Give me a 
couple of days to heal up, we can 
have a rematch."
 "Always happy to take a fellow navy 
man's money."
 After the watchers had gone back to 
their own brews, Erne said, "So what's 
the scut on the new battle station?"
 "The Death Star?" Tenn lowered his 
voice to a conspiratorial level. "I hear 
that anybody who can hit a resiplex 
wall from a meter away can have a 
berth if he wants it. But if you can 
really shoot, they'll let you run the big 
guns?including one that'll make our 
biggest weapons look like pocket 
slugthrowers."
 "No kidding?"
 "Guys like us, we got no problem," 
Tenn continued. "All we have to do is 
ask."
 "You gonna go for it?"
 "Now you're kidding. I'm a lifer; 
why wouldn't I? When this thing is 
finished, nothing anybody anywhere 
can field against it will even scratch 
the finish. Running a gun that will 
pop Star Destroyers like soap bubbles, 
maybe even knock a moon out of 
orbit?what kind of gunner would 
pass that up?" He grinned. "Bigger is 
better."
 "I hear security will be tight. No 
leaves once you sign on until after the 
station becomes operational."
 "And this is different from what 
we're now doing how? Besides, look 
at the size of it. It's gonna be like 
living on a moon?or in one. 
Thousands of decks. You can scan it 
and plug it so that everything a man 
could want will be somewhere in that 
sucker. Who needs shore leave when 
all you have to do is punch up the 
turbolift?"
 Erne allowed as how Tenn's 
evaluation of the Death Star's prurient 
possibilities made much sense. Both 
men drank more of their ales.
 "I've already told my exec I'm ready 
to sign on," Tenn said. "Soon as they 
get a gun working, enough air to 
breathe, and enough gravity to tell 
which way's up, I'm there."
 "Speaking of everything a man could 
want . . .  ," Erne said. He nodded at 
the door.
 Tenn turned. Ah. A pair of civilian 
workers from Supply?young, good-
