futile, wouldn't they?
 She blinked and looked closer. Oh.
 Oh!
 The secondary port, the unnecessary 
one that she'd tried to keep from being 
built! It was just beyond the main!
 Teela Kaarz was an architect, and a 
good one, and she had an engineer's 
eye. That portal was small, only two 
meters or so. If you didn't know it was 
there, you'd never spot it. The ray 
shielding at the mouth was minimal, 
meant to stop stray particle beams. 
And even if one of those got through, 
it would be absorbed by the 
anisotropic walls of the tube before it 
traveled half a kilometer, so no 
problem there.
 But if something like, say, a proton 
torpedo were to be fired directly into 
it. . .
 Her comlink chirped. The sound's 
clarity surprised her, because it wasn't 
coming from her pocket, where she'd 
thought she'd put it. She felt a quick 
surge of panic upon the realization; 
what if one of her coconspirators had 
tried to call? She looked about, 
spotted it on a shelf, grabbed it.
 "Yes?"
 It was Riten. He sounded very 
agitated. "I've been trying to reach 
you?why haven't you answered?"
 "Sorry. I left the comlink in my 
office."
 He hissed in exasperation. "It's past 
time to go, Teela!"
 "In a few minutes. I have to?"
 "You don't have a few minutes. You 
need to get to the rendezvous now!"
 "Listen, the Rebel attack?I know 
what they're up to!"
 "It doesn't matter what they're up to. 
Go!"
 "You don't understand! They could 
destroy the station!"
 There was a short pause, no more 
than a couple of heartbeats. Then: 
"So?"
 Teela blinked, confused by his 
response. "Riten?"
 "We live on a battle station called 
the Death Star, Teela. It's already 
killed billions of people, and you 
know it can and will do worse. 
Anybody who tries to stand against 
the Empire will feel its teeth. There's 
no limit to how many this 
abomination could slaughter."
 "But?all the people on board?"
 "Don't begin to approach the 
numbers who were on Alderaan. Go, 
Teela. Get off while you can. You 
don't want to be a part of this any 
further."
 Her emotions warred with 
themselves. All her work. All the 
dead of Despayre and Alderaan, and 
all those who might yet die. All her 
friends and colleagues. Civilians. 
Prisoners. A thousand worlds within 
easy reach of the Death Star.
 He was right.
 "Go, now!" "All right," she said.
 She left the images floating over her 
desk and hurried out into the corridor.



FLIGHT CORRIDOR SEVENTEEN, 
DEATH STAR

 Vader strode down the hall, where 
he came upon a pair of his own pilots. 
It was time for him to take the field. 
These Rebels were up to something?
he could feel it. To the pilots he said, 
"Several fighters have broken off 
from the main group. Come with me."
 His TIE fighter was fueled and 
ready?it was always fueled and 
ready?and he would personally show 
the Rebels what happened when you 
went up against Darth Vader. His 
prototype craft was the Advanced 
X1?faster, better armed, and 
equipped with short-range hyperspace 
capabilities that the older models did 
not have.
 Whatever the resistance upstarts had 
in mind, he was going to stop it.
 Vader gestured, and the hatch to his 
fighter slid open as if by itself.
 He climbed into the ship, fired up 
the engines, and, with his two wing-
mates, flew through the open bay 
doors and into the black coldness of 
space.



MEDCENTER, DEATH STAR

 Uli, having just received the comm 
call from Riten, was in his office 
packing a small tote with the few 
mementos of a military life. Suddenly 
the door panel opened without 
buzzing first. Two military security 
officers, uniforms starched and 
creased, hair severely cut and wearing 
implacable frowns, stepped in.
 "Captain Dr. Kornell Divini?" one of 
them asked.
 Uli stared at them, feeling the hope 
that had burned in his heart for the 
last few hours flare and go out. It was 
over. They'd been discovered. All that 
was left to look forward to now was a 
speedy military trial and then a 
blasting squad.
 He felt no fear for himself, oddly 
enough. What he felt was that he'd let 
two people down?two women who 
had made a big difference in his life: 
Princess Leia Organa and Jedi Barriss 
Offee.
 "Yes," he said. No point in denying 
it; no point in denying anything 
anymore. "I'm Dr. Divini."
 The other officer said, "You are 
under arrest for violation of Statute 
OB-CPO-One-One-Nine-Eight, 
illegal medical research."
 "Come with us, please," the first one 
ordered.
 Uli was too astonished to ask any 
questions, which was probably just as 
well. The two security officers 
marched him out of his office and 
down the passage toward the main 
conduit corridor. They fell in with the 
traffic flow of servicemen, civilian 
workers, and droids, most of whom 
gave Uli and his escorts a wide berth.
 Uli was relieved that his friends and 
co-conspirators were evidently not in 
the same jam that he was. They 
apparently still stood a chance of 
escaping. At least he wasn't dragging 
them down with him.
 But illegal medical research? What 
could he have possibly done that 
qualified as?
 And then he remembered.
 Sergeant Stihl's midi-chlorians. He'd 
put up an inquiry on the Med-Net 
weeks ago concerning them. He'd 
never gotten a response, and, 
eventually, what with the workload 
and all, he'd forgotten about it. He 
remembered wondering at the time if 
posting the question had been a good 
idea.
 Evidently not. . .



POLAR TRENCH TWELVE, DEATH STAR

 Vader said to his two wingmates, 
"Stay in attack formation." There 
were three Y-wings diving at the 
station, making for one of the 
trenches. Were they mad? They 
couldn't do any real damage even if 
they deliberately plowed into the hull. 
But they must have something in 
mind . . .
 Vader switched to the Command 
Channel: "All guns in the D-Quadrant 
cease fire immediately."
 Three Y-wings, and they'd obviously 
chosen some kind of target they 
deemed vulnerable. To his wingmates 
he said, "I'll take them myself. Cover 
me."
 They acknowledged his order, but he 
wasn't listening.
 The trio fell in behind the Y-wings. 
It was but the work of a few seconds 
to lock on to the rearmost fighter. 
Vader thumbed his firing buttons . . .
 A hit.
 The ship exploded into a fireball. He 
flew through it.
 He lined up on the second fighter. 
He didn't even need to use the Force. 
There was no room for the fleeing 
Rebel pilot to maneuver.
 Vader fired. Another one destroyed.
 He lined up on the last Y-wing. Shot 
it. Another explosion.
 Too easy.
 Was this all they had?



UPPER DECK CORRIDOR, DEATH STAR

 "Uli walked with his two captors 
along the gently curving corridor. 
He'd often heard it said that once hope 
has been truly extinguished, once one 
realizes in one's heart that the race is 
over, there comes with the realization 
a feeling of serenity, of acceptance, of 
peace.
 There's often even a sense of relief at 
having the terrible uncertainty that is 
life resolved by death's inevitability. 
He believed it; he'd stood at the side 
of too many deathbeds, watching the 
occupants' final moments, to think 
otherwise. It wasn't the way everyone 
died, of course. But of those who 
passed away at least semiconscious 
and reasonably in possession of their 
faculties, a surprising number 
reported, moments before breathing 
their last, that they had entered this 
state of grace.
 Not Uli. He wasn't on his deathbed, 
but he certainly had reason to believe 
that his life had just ended. Maybe his 
value as a surgeon could save him, 
but he doubted it. His only chance at 
finally getting out of this lifelong 
insanity that was war had been 
snatched from him at the eleventh 
hour. Maybe it was because he was 
still in shock from the unexpected 
dashing of his escape plan, but what 
he was feeling certainly wasn't 
serenity. It was anger.
 His life had gone wrong the moment 
he'd set foot on the pestilent dirt of 
Drongar two decades earlier, although 
he hadn't realized it at the time. His 
plan had been to do his tour and rotate 
out, then start in private practice. Big 
Zoo on Alderaan had been his first 
choice. He'd seen himself, at this age, 
mostly retired save for the occasional 
consulting job, with a wife and kids.
 Instead his life had been one long 
series of bush assignments, frontline 
care, Republic and Imperial Mobile 
Surgical Units, and other work, most 
of it dangerous, wearisome, and 
thankless. And now, just when it 
looked like he might finally have the 
opportunity at last to change it, to be 
hoisted by an earlier attempt to do his 
job responsibly and morally, well. . .
 There was much to be said for it if 
one was a fan of irony.
 He might as well accept it?if such a 
thing as destiny existed, then his was 
obviously to be a military surgeon for 
the rest of his life? assuming said 
life wasn't cut short by blasterfire in 
the very near future. Perhaps it was 
only in resignation, in bowing to the 
inevitable, that he would find peace. 
Because it would take a miracle to 
rescue him now.
 The sound of a muffled explosion, 
more felt than heard, rumbled around 
them. Several passersby reacted 
nervously.
 "What was that?" Uli asked.
 At first he thought he wasn't going to 
receive an answer, but then one of the 
officers said, "Rebel fighters bombing 
the surface, is my guess."
 "Or going splat on it," the other 
suggested. This brought grim 
chuckles from both. Uli found the 
humor a little hard to appreciate.
 "All the good it'll do 'em," the first 
officer said. "Lord Vader's out there 
with his elites?those Rebel scum are 
dead men flying."
 "Let's take a lift down to Three-A," 
his partner suggested. "We can cut 
through Hydroponics and?"
 The wall exploded.
 Later Uli realized that it had to have 
been another bomb, or crash, on the 
surface just "above" them. At the time 
all he knew was that several nearby 
panels had erupted in a shower of 
sparks and shrapnel, causing panic 
among the nearby people. And in the 
smoke and general confusion, Uli 
found himself separated from his 
captors.
 There were many different deities 
worshipped on many different worlds, 
all supposedly capable of miracles. 
Uli had no idea which of them, if any, 
might have been responsible for this 
one, but he wasn't taking the time to 
question it, that was for sure.
 Better let them know I'm coming, he 
thought. He pulled his comlink from a 
pocket as he ran through the panicked 
crowd, fumbled it, and saw it vanish 
into the stampeding chaos.
 According to his chrono he had less 
than fifteen minutes to reach the 
rendezvous point. No time to even 
think about looking for the comlink. 
He ran faster.

STORAGE ROOM 3181, DEATH STAR
 
 Teela tapped the access code into the 
pad next to the door, which slid up to 
reveal the others, all dressed in 
medical transport grays. She 
wondered briefly how they'd ever 
found a size big enough for Rodo, and 
then Vil practically knocked her over 
when he hugged her. "Where have 
you been? I was worried sick! Get 
changed?hurry!"
 The room had no other 
compartments, and this was hardly the 
time for modesty anyway. Teela 
stripped and quickly donned a set of 
pale gray coveralls. There were 
medical insignia on the sleeves and 
breast.
 As she dressed, she looked at the 
others, doing a head count. Vil, 
Memah, Ratua, Rodo, Nova . . .
 "We're light two people," she said.
 "We've noticed," Ratua said. "We 
haven't heard from either the doc or 
the old man."
 Teela pulled her comlink and was 
about to input Uli's code when the 
room's access panel whooshed up 
again. Uli, red-faced and breathing 
hard, entered.
 "Cutting it kind of close, aren't we, 
Doc?" Nova asked.
 Uli gave him a strange look, almost 
as if he blamed the sarge for his 
tardiness. But all he said was, "I've 
got to listen to the advice I give my 
patients, and exercise."
 Teela's comlink cheeped. She 
thumbed it. "Riten?"
 "You made it to the rendezvous?"
 "I'm getting dressed now."
 "The others?"
 "They're all here. Except for you."
 "Good, good. You have less than ten 
minutes to get from there to the ship."
 "Where are you?"
 A slight hesitation. "In my office."
 "What?" Teela looked about, saw 
that the others were as shocked as she 
was. "But?you can't?"
 "I'm afraid there has been a glitch in 
the plan," Riten's voice said. "My 
faithful droid was a bit clumsy in its 
research, and as a result, it won't be 
able to fulfill its part. Somebody has 
to be here to vet the call from the man 
who will open the door for you. That 
would be me."
 "Can't you take the call on your 
comlink?"
 "Alas, no. My droid set it up, and I'm 
not technically skilled enough with 
hard- and firmwire to jigger what it 
did. It doesn't matter. I did a check on 
that possibility you brought up, and I 
think you're right, Teela. If that 
happens, no one will be coming for 
me. If it doesn't happen, well, I've had 
a long and enjoyable ride. No 
regrets."
 "Atour?"
 "No, no, not now. You don't have 
time. Get moving. Have a good life, 
child. Now go?all of you."
 He shut off the link from his end.
 Nobody moved or spoke for a few 
seconds.
 "Can't we go back for him?" Teela 
asked, fighting back tears. She knew 
the answer, of course, even before 
Memah said, "There's no time. All we 
can do is make sure his sacrifice isn't 
in vain."
 "She's right," Rodo said. "Let's go."
 Vil opened the door, and they moved 
into the corridor. "I really hope 
somebody knows where we're going," 
Ratua said.
 "This way," Nova said. "The 
entrance to the dock staging area is 
just around the next corner." He took 
the lead. The corridor widened out, 
ending in a blast door guarded by a 
pair of stormtroopers in black 
uniforms.
 Nova stepped up to one of them. 
"We've got an emergency medical 
flight."
 "Your orders?" the trooper said.
 "C'mon, Sarge, we're in a hurry. We 
got guys dying out there." "And if I 
let you in without scanning your 
orders, I'm gonna be dying in here."
 The fake orders were logged into the 
shuttle's computer. They didn't have 
any kind of flimsi or datachip on 
them. Nova said, "They didn't give us 
anything?the orders are on the ship."
 "Fine. I'll have somebody download 
and check them."
 Teela saw Nova glance at his 
chrono, then look at her. They had 
less than ten minutes before that 
tractor beam would be shut off, and it 
was only going to be offline for forty-
five seconds.
 They couldn't wait. Something had 
to be done, now.



CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MEDICAL BAY, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Nova knew they were out of time. 
There was only one course left open 
to them. He glanced at the other 
guard, then at Rodo, and knew, by 
that kind of telepathy fighters can 
sometimes share, that the big man 
understood.
 Nova turned back to the guard and 
shrugged. "Okay, you're in charge. 
Let me get you the comlink code?" 
and with that, he fired a punch into 
the guard's throat, flipped the man's 
helmet up with his free hand, then 
snapped an elbow to the now bare 
temple.
 The guard dropped. He saw the 
second guard fall as Rodo swept his 
feet from under him, then followed 
him down to the deck to bounce the 
guard's head against the plate. 
Excellent?both taken out with a 
minimum of fuss.
 "Let's go, people!" Nova opened the 
blast doors?
 Just as three squads of black-suited 
guards came around the corner. 
Fifteen men, in all. Fifteen armed 
men.
 The lieutenant in charge saw his two 
fallen comrades. "Hey, what the?"
 Nova said, "These men have been 
poisoned. We were called to take care 
of them and contain the area."
 That wouldn't work for long, he 
knew. Seven medics dispatched for 
just two guards? The lieutenant would 
have to be pretty challenged to buy 
that for more than a few seconds.
 Nova looked at Rodo again. 
"Whaddya say, Rodo?"
 Rodo nodded. He looked at the 
others, particularly at Memah. "Go," 
he said, softly.
 Memah stared at him, shocked. 
"Rodo, no!"
 Nova looked at Dance, jerked his 
thumb at the blast doors. "You're the 
only one who can do it, flyboy. Go!"
 There was a long moment that 
seemed to stretch to infinity, and then 
the others started to move.
 The lieutenant said, "Hold up there! 
Let me see your authorization." He 
approached, and his men followed.
 Nova held up a hand. "You'll need 
respirators," he said. "These two were 
gassed. Nerve toxin?better not get 
too close. I've got some antitoxin 
ampoules here, if you'll let me 
inoculate you and your men?"
 The guards were only a few meters 
away now. They showed no concern 
about any possible proximity to nerve 
gas.
 "You gonna take the right side?" 
Rodo said out of the corner of his 
mouth.
 "Yeah. Watch that little guy on the 
left?he's already got his hand on his 
blaster."
 "Copy. Nice knowing you, Nova."
 "You, too, Rodo."

CORRIDOR OUTSIDE MEDICAL BAY, 
DEATH STAR

 Ratua saw the action begin as if the 
participants were moving in slow 
motion. He was no fighter, but as the 
guards and Stihl and Rodo tangled, he 
saw one of the guards draw a blaster, 
and he knew his old jailer and the 
bouncer wouldn't be able to stop the 
man in time.
 But Celot Ratua Dil might.
 He moved as fast as he had ever 
moved in his life.
 The blaster came up, and the guard 
extended his arm. Ratua could see the 
man's finger begin to tighten, slowly, 
slowly . . .
 Ratua slammed into him. There was 
no skill involved?it was just a body 
block?but his speed magnified the 
force with which he struck the trooper 
enough to knock the latter into the 
corridor's far wall. The blaster 
clattered to the floor, followed by the 
unconscious trooper.
 Ratua was momentarily stunned 
himself, the impact having hit him 
just as hard, of course. But he'd been 
prepared for it. He reeled, but 
managed to stay on his feet until his 
head cleared.
 The world resumed its normal speed. 
He saw other troopers going for their 
blasters, but Stihl and Rodo were 
among them now, too close for the 
guards to shoot without risking hits on 
their own people.
 Time to leave.
 Memah, Vil, Teela, and Doc Divini 
were just inside the doors. Ratua 
moved to join them, kicking in the 
afterburner again. He slapped the 
hatch control as he blurred by it.
 The blast doors closed behind him 
and locked.
 The bay was a small one, used 
primarily for berthing and launching 
medical vessels. And there was their 
ticket to freedom, the E-2T shuttle, 
sitting on the landing turntable.
 As they approached, another officer 
came down the ramp. He eyed them 
suspiciously; Ratua was convinced 
that there was a certain rank of 
Imperial officers whose only job was 
to eye everything suspiciously.
 The officer, a sergeant major, said, 
"What do you people want here?"
 Uli stepped up. "I'm Dr. Divini," he 
said. "This is my team. We have a 
medical emergency we need to get to, 
stat. That's our ship."
 "Your orders?"
 "They're in the ship's computer. I'll 
transmit them from there once we've 
launched."
 "Protocol?"
 Uli stepped up close to the officer. 
"Shut it, man," he said in a low voice, 
"do you want to be responsible for the 
death of Admiral Daala?"
 The officer's eyes went wide. 
"Admiral Daala?"
 "Her ship has been hit by Rebel fire 
and we're detailed to collect her. You 
sure you want to be the man who held 
us up?"
 The officer stepped aside.
 "Let's go, people!" Uli said. "We've 
got a job to do."
 They moved quickly up the ramp 
into the shuttle, Ratua thinking, The 
doc's a pretty good con man. Who 
knew?
 Nova ducked a wild swing, caught 
the attacking guard's arm, and spun 
him into the trooper behind him. Both 
men fell, but he had no time to 
rejoice, because there were others 
coming for him, lots of others. He 
waded into a pair of guards and hit 
both at the same instant with a double 
punch, smashing their noses, then 
dropped and swept, upending another 
one, and before that one hit the deck 
he was up again firing a side kick into 
the belly of yet another?
 Beside him, Rodo grabbed a guard 
by his front, lifted him off his feet, 
and head-butted the man, knocking 
his helmet off, then threw him into 
another trooper. He whirled and took 
out two more with a spin kick.
 "We're having fun now, aren't we?" 
the big man said. He laughed.
 Nova recognized his recurring 
nightmare, which had now become 
reality. He didn't know the how or the 
why of it. He only knew that they 
were going to lose.
 Well, then?that was how it would 
be.
 They'd taken out a goodly number of 
guards, but there were still seven or 
eight of them standing, and the only 
reason he and Rodo hadn't been 
roasted yet was because the fighting 
had been too close for the guards to 
use their blasters. That was about to 
change, however. They were backing 
away, going for their weapons. The 
game would soon be over.
 Nova felt fear welling inside him. 
Not for himself; he knew he was a 
dead man fighting. Two against 
fifteen, the latter armed with blasters? 
A win was never in those cards. But it 
was vitally important that he prolong 
the fight as long as he could, to give 
the others time to escape.
 This would be his last dance, and he 
wanted it to be the best he could 
manage. Going up against impossible 
odds, going down swinging, using 
what he knew.
 There were a lot worse ways to 
check out.
 Beside him, Rodo grabbed a guard's 
head in both massive hands and 
twisted. The guard dropped, his neck 
broken. But another trooper had come 
up behind the big man, and now he 
thrust his blaster into Rodo's back. 
Nova saw Rodo's midsection turn 
black and charred as the energy beam 
burned its way through, saw Rodo's 
look of shock as he fell . . .
 He saw another trooper drawing 
down on him, saw the blaster's muzzle 
aimed at his head, and knew he could 
never reach it in time.
 The world turned white hot, like the 
center of a star, and then icy black, 
colder than space.

E-2T MEDSHUTTLE 5537

 Dance dropped into the pilot's seat 
and fired up the central processor. The 
heads-up display appeared.
 "Sublight drive up," he reported. 
"Now, if someone'll just open the 
door ..."
 It took only a couple of seconds for 
Door Control to query over the 
comm: "E-Two-Tee Medical Shuttle 
Five-Five-Three-Seven, why are you 
powering up?"
 Dance looked at Uli. Uli activated 
the comm.
 "This is Dr. Kornell Divini, op 
number 504614575. We have an 
emergency pickup."
 "Transmit your orders, Doctor."
 Uli looked at Dance. "Do it, Vil."
 Dance sent the file.
LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES, DEATH STAR
 The hardwired comm line lit. Atour 
picked up the headset. "Flight 
Control," he said.
 "Flight Control? The comm station 
must have given me the wrong 
connection. Sorry."
 Atour blinked. "Who are you trying 
to contact?"
 "The library. This is Lieutenant 
Esture. We just had a droid we were 
examining do a firmware meltdown 
and we need to talk to its supervisor."
 "Sorry I can't help you, Lieutenant?
we're kind of busy here."
 "Right. Out."
 Atour broke the connection and 
began to sweat. This was bad. They'd 
recheck the number and call again. If 
he didn't answer?and he had to 
answer, in case it was Bay Door 
Control?they'd know something was 
wrong, and they'd be sending 
somebody to have a little talk with 
him right away. Droids that suddenly 
went blank were rare enough that 
they'd suspect tampering. Add that to 
a comm number that was 
misconnected more than once, and 
even an Imperial officer could do the 
math.
 How much time did he have? 
Minutes, if he was lucky. Seconds, 
more likely . . .
 The comm lit again. Atour activated 
it. "Flight Control."
 "Flight Control, this is Bay Door 
Control Five-Seven-Five-Four-One. 
We have orders for departure of an E-
Two-Tee Medshuttle."
 Atour tried to sound bored. "Order 
number?"
 The tech read off the code. Atour 
counted slowly to three. "Ah, yeah, 
here it is. That's a valid number, 
Control. Let 'em go."
 "Copy that, Flight Control."
 Atour shut down the comm and 
leaned back in his chair. Now if P-
RC3's programming continued to 
work, the ship would be away in a 
moment or two, and if anybody tried 
to stop it with the rigged tractor 
beam?which they might, because 
Tractor Beam Control wouldn't have a 
copy of the ship's order in its 
computer any more than the real 
Flight Control did?then, in theory, 
the beam wouldn't work and they 
should fly free.
 In theory.
 In any event, there was nothing else 
he could do now. He rose and stepped 
away from his desk. If Teela Kaarz's 
evaluation of the danger was correct, 
and if the Rebels could read the plans 
well enough to spot the design flaw?
both entirely reasonable 
assumptions?then the Death Star 
might have only a few minutes more 
of existence left to it. If that indeed 
proved to be the case, he knew where 
he wanted to spend those last few 
minutes.
 Atour walked into the stacks until he 
was surrounded by shelves of various 
data storage. Tapes, chips, disks, even 
books. As always, it comforted him to 
be encompassed by knowledge. He 
sat down on a bench.
 A pity he would never write that 
book. The destruction of the Death 
Star would have made a powerful 
final chapter. Ah, well. . . perhaps 
someone else would put stylus to 
screen someday and tell the tale.
 Atour smiled. He took a deep breath
