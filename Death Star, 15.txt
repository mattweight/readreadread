you don't want him closer than a step 
and a half unless you're doing 
something active to him?inside that, 
he's too close. He'll get you with that 
blade more often than not, and it only 
takes one time to ruin your day.
 "So?let me show you the step-in to 
steal that crucial distance again . . . "
 The drills went on. The students 
practiced the moves with Nova 
walking around, making corrections, 
offering direction, telling them when 
they had it wrong and when they had 
it right. He liked to think he was an 
encouraging teacher. He always 
seemed to develop a core of regulars, 
even though turnover among newbies 
was usually pretty good?a lot of 
folks wanted to be able to kill 
someone with their bare hands, but 
they didn't want to do the months or 
years of work necessary to develop 
the skills.
 The air in the rec room seemed to 
change, suddenly and subtly. Nova 
could feel it without having to look 
around.
 Danger had entered the room.
 Without making it obvious as he 
helped a student find the proper hand 
position for a punch, he turned 
slightly.
 Standing just inside the door was 
Rodo, the bouncer from the Hard 
Heart.
 Nova grinned slightly, and caught 
the other's grin in return. The class 
would be over in five minutes, and he 
knew Rodo's timing wasn't an 
accident. His smile became wider, as 
well as slightly rueful. He was tired, 
he was hungry, and he hadn't been 
expecting it?but that's how it always 
went, wasn't it? Those were the 
conditions one trained for.
 He'd gotten his First Level Adept 
after a grueling two-hour class that 
had involved a lot of groundwork, 
athletic rolling around and grappling. 
That kind of stuff wore you out pretty 
quickly. His master had waited until 
the class was over and the students 
headed for the sonic showers when 
he'd pulled Nova aside. "I think it's 
time you took the test," he'd said.
 The sudden adrenaline rush had 
gripped Nova, briefly washing away 
his fatigue. "Really? When?"
 "Right now."
 Nova smiled at the memory. The test 
had taken almost four hours. The old 
man had turned him upside down and 
inside out; he'd taken him apart like a 
malfunctioning droid. And he'd been 
right to do so. After all, a footpad on 
the street wasn't going to wait until 
you felt your best. You had to be 
ready at any moment to fight to the 
death, if necessary. Otherwise the 
teachings weren't worth knowing.
 At the end of the session, Nova 
dismissed his students, many of 
whom were obviously wondering 
what the Hard Heart's bouncer was 
doing here. Nova moved over to 
where Rodo was holding up the wall. 
He's big enough to hold it up, he 
thought.
 Might as well get to it; he wasn't 
getting any less tired.
 He said, "So, you want to go a 
couple of rounds?"
 Rodo shrugged, his shoulders 
shifting like tectonic plates. "I 
wouldn't mind. 'Course, if dancing 
with your charity cases has tired you 
out?"
 "Thanks for your concern. Light 
spar?"
 Rodo nodded. "Fine by me."
 Back when Nova had been a 
beginner, there had been two kinds of 
sparring matches generally allowed. 
Heavy sparring required the donning 
of bulky, padded biogel suits. Even 
though the gel was relatively 
lightweight, it added five kilos to you 
at minimum, not to mention slowing 
reaction time and reducing range of 
movement considerably. A suited-up 
attacker charging you could shrug off 
a strike that would deck an 
unprotected fighter and keep coming.
 Early on in his training Nova learned 
to answer the question Light or heavy 
sparring? with the former. Of course, 
the only difference in the two was the 
suit?you hit just as hard in "light 
sparring," but since you knew you 
could get seriously damaged if you 
made a mistake, you were more 
careful.
 Nova closed the door and latched it. 
"You need to warm up?"
 Rodo shook his head. "Nah. You 
need a nap?"
 Nova shook his head and grinned. 
He walked to the center of the padded 
room and turned to face Rodo.
 Teras kasi had half a dozen basic 
stances, and Nova was comfortable 
with them all, having practiced them 
thousands of times. But as Rodo 
ambled toward him, he didn't shift his 
feet into one of the TK defensive 
plants. He stayed in a neutral pose, 
shoulders relaxed, feet about shoulder 
width apart, his left foot a hair ahead 
of his right. No point in giving his 
opponent any clues as to his style 
until the fight began.
 Nova knew he was starting at a 
disadvantage. Even beyond his being 
tired, there was the simple fact that 
Rodo outmassed him by a good 
twenty kilos and stood almost a head 
taller. Everything else being equal? 
and so far, Nova'd seen nothing to 
indicate that Rodo's fighting skills 
were better than his own?the 
advantage always lay with the bigger 
man.
 But Rodo didn't know about Nova's 
Blink. That probably made them even.
 Probably . . . 
 Rodo stopped just outside his own 
step and a half, slightly longer than 
Nova's range. A two-step position was 
too far to attack; the defender would 
have plenty of time to get set. A 
single step was too close.
 Nova held his ground.
 Rodo circled to his left.
 Nova turned, shifting slightly, his 
weight on the balls of his feet and 
pivoting on both incrementally. He 
bent his knees a bit, sinking a little 
lower.
 Rodo moved his hands, circling to a 
high-low, left-over-right position, 
pulled them in closer to his body, 
leaned away a hair, and stole half a 
step closer.
 It was a good fake. That upper-body 
motion would make you think Rodo 
had moved back when in fact he had 
moved in.
 Nova stepped off neutral to a side 
stance and used the angle to steal back 
the half step, maintaining their 
distance. Rodo nodded. "Nice," he 
said.
 Nova did a back crossover step, right 
foot behind the left, giving Rodo what 
looked like an unbalanced and 
awkward target. The bigger man 
shook his head. "Maybe not."
 Nova circled to his left, stopped, and 
pivoted, putting his left side forward 
at about forty-five degrees.
 Rodo mirrored the move and 
dropped his center of gravity a couple 
of centimeters. Since he was taller, if 
Nova got to his attack range, Rodo 
would already be there. The bouncer 
was a big man, and that no doubt 
tended to favor him in distance 
fighting. But he also worked in a can-
tina, where encounters would be 
close.
 Rodo begin to sway ever so slightly, 
turning his hips. Nova repressed a 
smile. Did the other man think he 
could be lulled like a rikitik facing a 
naga? He couldn't be fooled that 
easily. He knew that if he grappled 
with a guy that much bigger and 
stronger than him, he'd have to have 
angle, leverage, and a base, or he'd 
lose. That wasn't a matter of skill so 
much as it was simple physics?
 Rodo charged, and Nova barely got 
out of the way in time. He cursed 
himself for a fool even as he dropped 
and did a fast leg sweep. He'd lost 
focus for just an instant, and that's all 
it had taken to almost lose the match. 
If it weren't for his ability to sense 
another's moves, Rodo would have 
had him. The big man was fast.
 Their shins connected, smacking 
together like boards, but Rodo was 
more flexible than he appeared. He 
jumped, foiling the sweep, but having 
to step far enough out in doing so that 
he couldn't punch in passing. Nova 
did a stutter step, broke it short, and 
got within range. He went in with a 
triple punch, high, low, high. There 
was no way to block all three, but 
Rodo didn't back up; instead he 
stepped in and threw a horizontal 
elbow strike. Nova sensed that one 
coming before Rodo started it, 
blocked with an open hand, and tried 
a lock. Rodo countered with one of 
his own, stepped out, and turned?
 And they were back where they 
started.
 Rodo chuckled, and in a moment it 
turned into a laugh, and Nova joined 
him. Both men straightened from their 
fighting crouches and relaxed. The 
actual fighting time Nova estimated as 
thirty seconds or less.
 "We done?" Rodo said.
 "I think so," Nova said. No point, 
really, in continuing; they were too 
evenly matched. There was no alpha 
male here.
 "You have some outstanding moves, 
friend," he told the bouncer.
 "You'd know," the bigger man said. 
He extended his hand, as did Nova.
 "Where'd you get that hip fake?" 
Nova asked.
 "Changa bushfighting. What about 
that sweep? That's not classical teras 
kasi."
 "Sera Plinck, Jalinese knife."
 Rodo nodded. They had given each 
other new moves. A valuable 
exchange.
 Nova realized that his tiredness was 
gone. He hadn't had a chance to play 
with a fighter this good in years. It 
was rare, these days, to run into 
someone skilled enough to learn from.
 "You ever see any Velanarian 
boxing?" he asked.
 "Yeah, the crosscut version. Used to 
know a guy had some of that. Hard to 
get the moves down when you've only 
got two arms, but . . . " He shrugged. 
"Gotta get back to work. C'mon 
along?drinks are on me."
 This, Nova told himself, could be the 
start of a great friendship.

ARCHITECTURAL OFFICE SUITE, 
EXECUTIVE LEVEL, DEATH STAR
 
 Teela Kaarz blinked at the man in 
front of her. "Where's the Wookiee 
chief? Hahrynyar?"
 "He took sick," the man said. "Had 
to go to the clinic, isn't well enough to 
come back to work yet. I'm 
pushrodding this shift."
 "And it was your idea to build this 
exhaust port?" She gestured at the 
expanded holo of the station's plans. 
The much-debated port, near the 
"north pole" of the meridian trench, 
was clearly visible.
 "No, it wasn't my idea. It's on the 
plans."
 "I talked to the Wookiee about that."
 The man, a graybeard who was a 
hand span shorter and fifty kilos 
heavier than she was, shrugged. 
"Yeah? Well, sorry, but what you told 
him didn't get passed on. The plans 
called for an exhaust port and that's 
what they pay me to do, follow the 
plans. Unless you, uh, maybe got an 
exception and wrote it down?"
 Disgusted with herself, Teela shook 
her head. "I didn't have a chance to 
get to it."
 He shrugged again. "Not my fault."
 She nodded. That was true, it wasn't 
his fault. "Okay," she said. "Done is 
done. What about the heat exchangers 
on the barracks levels?"
 "Ninety-eight percent complete, 
down to routers and capacitors, and 
we'll have those online in a couple 
more shifts, no problem."
 That much was good, anyway.
 "The walkway escalators from Six to 
Seven?"
 "Done. We can crank them 
anytime."
 "And the pocket park on Nine is 
where?"
 "Laid out, greensward all seeded, the 
big trees and foliage planted pumps 
and pipes installed, and the channels 
and ponds cast and hard-set. All we 
need is for Hydrology to deliver the 
water and power to light it up."
 Teela looked at her datalog. 
Everything was coming along on 
time, and some things, like the tiny 
patch of greenery up on Nine, were 
actually ahead of schedule. 
Hahrynyar's substitute was certainly 
keeping the Wookiee's rep spotless. 
Okay, so they'd put in a heat exhaust 
port that wasn't really needed. It 
hadn't slowed down anything else, 
and it Certainly wouldn't hurt 
anything by being there. In fact, given 
the size of the reactor, and the heat it 
would generate at full power, it was 
probably better to have too many 
vents than too few.
 It was always a good idea to err on 
the side of safety.
 "All right," she said. "Just keep me 
in the circuit."
 "Of course."
 After he left her office, Teela looked 
over the schedule again. Her portion 
of the construction was on time and 
on budget, true enough, but she wasn't 
the only architect on the project, and 
as it sometimes happened, the good 
suffered for the faults of the bad. She 
expected a call from her boss anytime 
now, telling her she was going to have 
to cut costs or speed up?or both. It 
wasn't fair or right, but if you could 
carry your load, then you were often 
asked to help somebody else carry 
theirs.
 "Teela Kaarz?"
 Teela looked up. Her receptionist 
droid stood in the doorway of her 
office.
 "Yes?"
 "Senior Project Manager Stinex 
sends his regards and asks that you 
come by his office at your 
convenience."
 Teela nodded. Well, there it was, just 
like she expected. "Inform the senior 
PM I'll be by in an hour, if that's okay 
with him." There was no help for it. 
That was how things worked.
 She noticed the droid was still there. 
"What?"
 "You have a call incoming from a 
Lieutenant Villian Dance."
 Teela grinned. "Put that through. 
And close the door on your way out."
 Despite her resolve, the dashing TIE 
pilot had charmed her. He was funny, 
clever, and not bad-looking. Given 
her job and trustee status, it wasn't as 
though she had much time for 
recreation, and a man who made her 
laugh was worth something.
 Her viewscreen blossomed with the 
image of Vil Dance. He tossed her a 
jaunty salute, two fingers off his 
brow. "Good shift, Lady Teela?"
 She smiled. "Not too bad so far, 
Lieutenant. I hope your own is going 
well."
 "It just improved a thousand 
percent."
 Smooth, she thought. As smooth as 
the surface of a neutron star. "To what 
do I owe the honor of this call?"
 "Ah, well, as it happens, I know 
somebody who knows somebody who 
is a friend of the cook in the new 
Melahnese restaurant that just opened 
on the Rec Deck food court. You 
fancy fodu in green fire sauce?"
 "One of my favorites."
 "I thought maybe you'd like spicy 
food. I can get us a table, swing shift. 
My treat."
 "How can a lieutenant afford such 
exotic cuisine? I hear it's very 
expensive to eat there."
 He gave her a disarming shrug. "Not 
a lot to burn credits on out here," he 
said. "And since at any moment I 
might be leaving on a mission from 
which I won't return, I figure might as 
well spend the money on something?
someone?worthwhile."
 She laughed. "How long are you 
going to milk that particular routine?"
 "I can see I'll have to try something 
else, since you are a coldhearted fern 
unaffected by the prospect of my 
possible demise. So?dinner?"
 She could see her conscience in her 
mind's eye, shaking its head. You'll be 
sorry . . . 
 Space it, she told her inner self. 
"Well, I do have to eat," she said 
aloud. "What time?"
 He flashed her that gigawatt smile. 
"Nineteen hundred?"
 "I'll meet you there."
 "Just made my day, Teela."
 "We do what we can to keep the 
troops happy."
 After they disconnected, she leaned 
back in her chair, feeling somewhat 
bemused with herself.
 Nothing would come of any liaison 
between them, not in the long term. 
He was a pilot and?despite his ironic 
bravado?likely to get blown out of 
the vacuum sooner or later. And she 
was a prisoner who might get some 
consideration after the station was 
built, but there were no guarantees 
there, either.
 Still, there was a war going on, and 
you had to take your joys where you 
could find them. When built, this 
battle station would be weapon-proof, 
and she might be allowed to stay on 
assignment after the basic design was 
finished?perhaps even after this 
thing was ready to roll out and over 
any resistance in its way. There would 
still be changes, both in design and 
construction, taking place. The fact 
that she was working for the enemy 
still troubled her occasionally, but 
she'd rationalized it away, for the 
most part. And anyway, a job and a 
place to sleep weren't the only 
considerations in a woman's life. It 
was better, in the present 
circumstances, to take it one day at a 
time and enjoy each as best she could.
 And Lieutenant Vil Dance sounded 
like he knew how to make life 
enjoyable.



MAIN CORRIDOR OUTSIDE THE HARD 
HEART CANTINA, DECK 69, DEATH 
STAR
 
 This new deal he had in mind, if he 
pulled it off, would leave Ratua sitting 
very pretty indeed. It was technically 
illegal?which was moot because, 
given his situation, everything he did 
was technically illegal?but in this 
case, nobody would come to any 
harm. The Empire was pouring credits 
into this project like water onto a 
forest fire; a few buckets here and 
there wouldn't be missed, and what 
was beneath their notice would fix 
things so he wouldn't have to work for 
a while.
 He was feeling pretty good, all in all, 
as he walked confidently down the 
gently curving corridor toward the 
recreation area. He mulled over his 
plans on his way to see Memah 
Roothes, the most beautiful and 
interesting female he had run across 
in, well . . .  forever. The cantina was 
just ahead, up the corridor a hundred 
meters or so, when the bouncer, Rodo, 
emerged. Ratua started to call out and 
wave, but then, half a step behind 
Rodo, a second man exited the 
cantina. It took him a second to place 
the second fellow, the context and 
surroundings being utterly different 
from where Ratua had last 
encountered him. When he did, a chill 
washed over him like a splash of 
liquid nitrogen.
 It was Sergeant Nova Stihl, the same 
man for whom he'd sometimes 
participated in martial arts 
demonstrations back in Slashtown.
 Without missing a step Ratua turned 
into the next doorway, a shop 
featuring femwear, resisting the urge 
to kick in the afterburner. He 
pretended to peruse the racks of 
selections and gaze at the 
holomannequins. As he did, he could 
feel fear roiling in his belly like one 
of the dianoga rumored to infest 
downlevels. Stihl was a decent man, 
but there was no doubt where his 
loyalties lay, and it wasn't with 
escaped prisoners.
 A droid rolled up, gyroscopically 
balanced on a single wheel. "How 
may I assist you, sir?"
 Calm down! "I need, uh, something, 
ah, festive for a female friend."
 "Species?"
 "Twi'lek."
 "Skin tone?"
 "Um,teal."
 "How festive, sir?"
 "Oh, you know. Very."
 "Right this way. We have a selection 
of Twi'lek wear in the correct color 
coordinates. Something in hisp-silk, 
perhaps? Sleep gowns? Micro-
garments?"
 Ratua followed the droid to the back 
of the shop. There were no other 
customers or staff about that he could 
see. There was a window at the shop's 
front, and all he wanted was to be sure 
his back was to it. He paid scant 
attention to the droid as it held 
something filmy and nearly 
transparent up for his inspection. 
"Yes, yes, that's nice. What else do 
you have?"
 His mind whirled. He hadn't 
expected to see anybody he knew 
here. None of his fellow prisoners 
were likely to be wandering the 
station on their own, and what were 
the chances one of the few guards he 
had known personally on the prison 
world would be transferred here?
 Apparently much greater than he had 
expected.
 When you thought about it, it made 
sense. They'd need guards on the 
station, because a place as big as this 
was becoming would definitely have 
crime popping up, even if it was no 
more than deckhands getting drunk 
and disorderly. And that wouldn't be 
the only problem. Put a million people 
into an enclosed space, even one as 
huge as the Death Star, and there were 
going to be a fair number of bad eggs. 
Military discipline wasn't the easiest 
thing to live under, plus there were all 
those civilian contractors. Yeah, 
they'd definitely need detention 
centers and guards and who better 
than guys who had hands-on 
experience on a planet full of real 
criminals?
 Okay, so it was reasonable. But that 
wasn't the problem, was it? If Stihl 
saw him, he was cooked, no two ways 
about it. And that was definitely going 
to put a bend in his ability to court 
Memah. He couldn't risk going into 
the cantina if, as he suspected, Rodo 
and Stihl had become pals. It certainly 
wasn't surprising?given their joint 
love of hand-to-hand violence, it was 
inevitable that they'd either be bosom 
buddies or mortal enemies. 
Regardless, his potential romance was 
over before?
 Hold on, hold on, wait a second. He 
had told Memah who he was. For 
maybe the second time in his life, he 
had offered the truth. She knew he 
was an escapee, and?so far, at 
least?had done nothing. He could 
just tell her about this. They could 
work out something . . . 
 "How about this item?"
 He looked at the droid. It held up a 
piece of crimson silk that he could 
easily hide in his hand, with two 
fingers left over. The mental image of 
Memah wearing nothing but this filled 
his thoughts, momentarily banishing 
that of Sergeant Stihl. Oh, my.
 "I'll take that. And that other thing, 
too."
 "Very good, sir. Debit code?"
 "How about hard currency?"
 "That will be fine, sir. Shall I gift-
wrap these for you?"
 "Uh, yes. That would be good."
 Ratua walked out of the store 
carrying the packages, in a 
considerably more sober mood than 
he'd been in a few minutes before. He 
had a few nice gifts for Memah, 
though they might be a bit premature, 
given the nature of their relationship. 
He would hold on to them for a while 
and hope to see her in one, someday 
soon.
 And when he thought about it, 
maybe Stihl wasn't so much a threat 
after all. The man was in the military, 
so his work schedule had to be 
somewhere in the ship's computer. 
Those files could be accessed by 
somebody with sufficient expertise?
and with enough credits, such 
expertise could be purchased by a 
careful person. If you knew when and 
where someone was going to be a 
large portion of the time, you could 
avoid accidentally running into him.
 He felt himself relax a little. Things 
weren't so bad. Once again, luck had 
been on his side. He was almost 
coming to believe that he led a 
charmed life.

LIBRARY AND ARCHIVES, DECK 106, 
SECTOR N-ONE, DEATH STAR
 
 "Hold still, Persee." "I am 
motionless, sir," the droid said.
 Atour Riten frowned. If that was 
true, then his hands must be shaking a 
bit. Was he really that old?
 "Almost done here," he said. "A bit 
more patience . . ."
 "I have infinite patience, sir, being a 
droid. However, I am constrained to 
point out that your current actions 
would seem to be in violation of the 
Imperial Legal Code, Section 
Fourteen, Subsection Nine, Part C-
dash-one, which forbids tampering 
with autonomous droid function 
without official permission."
 "So it would seem. But I have 
permission." He inserted the photonic 
cable and turned it until it locked into 
place.
 "I show no record of such 
permission, sir."
 "Hand-delivered this morning," 
Atour said. "My-eyes-only, very 
hush-hush."
 "Really, sir? This is most unusual. I 
feel I must verify?"
 The droid's last comment was 
interrupted when Atour touched the 
transfer button on his datastick, and 
the program contained therein began 
to download into Persee's memory. 
The droid sagged slightly, and its 
photoreceptors dimmed.
 The personality substrate would 
remain the same; Atour did not want 
to disturb the droid's abilities, good 
help being so hard to come by. There 
were only two items that would be 
substantially changed. First, Persee's 
spyware, which required it to monitor 
its work environment and to report on 
any activities that might be remotely 
illegal according to Imperial statutes, 
would shortly be disabled. Second, its 
basic loyalty module, set up to put the 
good of the Empire at the top of its 
function pyramid as defined by its 
Imperial programmer, was being 
altered to shift this loyalty to Atour 
personally.
 Persee was, in a few more seconds, 
going to become Atour Riten's servant 
first and foremost, and anything it saw 
or heard its master do from now on, it 
would keep to itself. Any tampering 
with its memory chip in an attempt to 
bypass the new programming would 
result in a total memory wipe, right 
down to the primary nodes. What 
would be left wouldn't be able to 
walk, talk, or do much of anything 
else. After all, an assistant who might 
consciously or unconsciously betray 
him to Imperial agencies, either 
covert or overt, wasn't of much use.
 Atour had been able to access some 
wonderful material over his years of 
filing and cataloging. This droid-
altering program had been one of his 
best finds. Hook it up, pop it in, and 
zip! Just like that, you had a new best 
friend who would do anything to keep 
you from harm. Anyone who queried 
Persee would get reasonable 
assurances that Commander Atour 
Riten was a prince of a fellow, as 
honest as the galaxy was wide, and 
this would hold true no matter how 
insistent the questioner. If it went past 
a certain point, Persee would suffer a 
firmware breakdown and, whatever 
anyone might suspect, there would be 
nothing to find indicating sedition.
 The memory of the transfer itself 
would also be erased from Persee's 
mind. The droid wouldn't have a clue 
that any tampering had been done, or 
that it was any different when it 
walked out of the office than when it 
had walked in.
 There was a ping! as the download 
ended. Atour unlocked and then 
removed the cable; the entire process 
had taken only a couple of seconds. 
He counted to ten.
 Right on schedule the droid's 
photoreceptors lit. "Will there be 
anything else, sir?" Persee asked.
 "No, I think that will do it for now. 
Systems check."
 The droid replied, with no 
discernible delay, "My circuits, 
modules, and mechanics are all 
operating at optimum, sir."
 "Well, good," Atour said. He made 
an airy gesture of dismissal. "Toodle 
off, then."
 After the droid left, Atour felt better. 
There was no way he could do many 
of the things he was accustomed to 
doing with a blabbermouth droid 
looking over his shoulder and 
transmitting it all to the local security 
computer. The chances of anybody 
ever grilling Persee until it blew a 
circuit were very slim, but still, 
chance favored the better-prepared 
life-form.
 He had a group of new junior 
librarians coming in for orientation 
later in the day, and tons of things to 
do before they showed up. His 
personal files were proof against any 
of them stumbling across anything 
secret by accident or intent. He 
assumed as a matter of course that one 
or more of them had to be some kind 
of Imperial spy. That was usually the 
case in any organization, and even if 
it weren't, it was better to make that 
assumption and be wrong than to not 
make it and be thrown into prison for 
underestimating the powers-that-were. 
A man didn't get to be his age and 
status by being completely foolhardy, 
even though he had certainly stepped 
over the line a time or ten. In his 
lifelong war against authority, he had 
won more battles than he had lost, 
even if they didn't know it.
 Much to do, he reminded himself, 
and little time in which to do it. Best 
get moving.
