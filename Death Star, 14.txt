Take off, and if I miss, you're free.'"
 Motti shook his head. Un-fripping-
believable.
 "So the two, figuring they're dead 
men anyway, charge him. Pojo pulls 
that customized blaster faster than you 
can believe?his hand, the gun, they 
were just a blur?those guys hadn't 
taken two steps. He cooks off a round 
and shoots the sodder on the left right 
between the eyes, zap! Then he aims 
at the second pirate, who's still 
running at him, and squeezes off 
another bolt."
 "Let me guess: he missed?"
 "Nope. Blaster shorted out. Hiss, 
pop, crackle. The capacitor must have 
overloaded, and the gun flared. Pojo 
drops it, goes for his backup?no 
gunnery loot would carry just the one 
gun, but by that time, the pirate was in 
his face. Sodder had a shiv. Just a 
low-tech blade, not even a vibro, one 
step above a flint knife.
 "By the time I lined up and shot the 
pirate, he'd buried that knife in Pojo's 
throat. The medics couldn't get there 
in time."
 Motti smiled. "A multibillion-credit 
battle station is not exactly a pijer-
rigged blaster, Admiral."
 "The more complex a weapon, the 
more likely it is to have flaws," Helaw 
said. "Kan Pojo was the best pistoleer 
I ever saw, then or since, but he was 
waxed by what was essentially a 
whittled rock when his state-of-the-art 
weapon failed."
 "I'm not too worried about pirates 
with knives, Jaim."
 "You should be, son," the grizzled 
old admiral said. "You should be 
worried about everything."
 
 
 
ADMIRAL MOTTI'S LIGHTER, TWO 
HUNDRED KILOMETERS OFF 
UNDAUNTABLE'S PORT STERN
 
 Did the old man have a valid point? 
Motti wondered. It was hard to see 
how. The Death Star was a true 
Dreadnaught, a giant among midgets. 
Of course, just about every fable 
about giants tended to end with the 
midgets triumphing somehow. 
Perhaps it wouldn't be a bad idea, 
once he was back on board, to order a 
detailed inspection of the 
superstructure and the plans. 
Maintenance would howl, but that 
didn't matter. After all, Motti hadn't 
gotten to his rank by assuming 
everything was as it should be. Like 
as not the old man was just being 
paranoid. But in situations like these, 
with the fate of the galaxy literally 
riding on the outcome, it was hard to 
be too paranoid . . . 
 Motti was still musing about Helaw's 
story when the Star Destroyer 
Undauntable suddenly ceased to be 
the oldest ship of the line in the 
quadrant behind him.
 In a brilliant, silent white-hot blast 
the Undauntable blew apart.

COMMAND DECK, OVERBRIDGE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 "You were there," Tarkin said. "I 
didn't blow it up," Motti replied.
 Tarkin silently counted to ten. 
Behind him, at a discreet distance, 
Daala stood, pretending not to hear 
their conversation.
 "What could have happened?"
 "It could have been an accident," 
Motti said.
 "You don't really think that."
 "No more than you do, sir. Admiral 
Helaw was as good as any 
commander in the Imperial Navy and 
better than most. I cannot imagine an 
accident of this magnitude would 
happen on a ship he ran."
 "The Undauntable was an old ship."
 "Even so."
 Tarkin nodded. "I'm afraid I agree." 
He paused. "It would be better if it 
had been an accident."
 Motti said nothing, but Tarkin knew 
the man was no fool. He understood.
 "Darth Vader's recent visit was 
supposed to have eliminated the threat 
of sabotage," Tarkin continued.
 "So I understand. Apparently it did 
not."
 "If that is the case, we could, I 
expect, depend on another visit from 
Vader in short order. Not the worst 
thing that could happen to us, but 
certainly another burden we don't 
need, with sprawl construction nearly 
complete."
 "One would expect such a visit, 
yes."
 "Whereas if there was an accident, 
on an old ship?a leaky hyper-matter 
containment valve, perhaps . . .  that 
would be unfortunate, but 
understandable, and there would be 
no need for the Emperor's 
representative to come all the way out 
here again."
 Motti frowned deeper. "It would be a 
shame, however, for such an 'accident' 
to be laid at the feet of Jaim Helaw, 
whose memory would forever bear 
that blot on his otherwise perfect 
record."
 "It would be a shame. However, with 
Jaim dead, that won't really bother 
him, will it? And he had no family."
 Motti said, "The navy was his 
family."
 "Just so. And Jaim was loyal to the 
bone. He would not wish his 'family' 
to suffer, would he?"
 Motti didn't like it, that was plain, 
but Motti was also a loyalist. There 
was no need for Tarkin to remind him 
of his duty. The admiral nodded, a 
crisp, military motion. "So, then: an 
unfortunate accident, and a single 
black mark on an otherwise brilliant 
career."
 "Unfortunate, indeed," Tarkin 
replied. "And we all move on."
 After Motti was gone, Daala moved 
over to stand next to Tarkin. "Isn't this 
a bit risky?"
 "Not really. Motti is ambitious, and 
he knows this station is his transport 
to greatness. He'll be promoted to 
Moff as soon as the Rebels are 
vanquished, and it would be foolish 
for him to raise a fuss about this. He 
liked the old man?I was rather fond 
of him myself?but nothing we can 
say or do will bring him back, and 
better that his death serves us rather 
than gets in our way. So, it was a 
terrible accident. These things 
happen."
 She nodded. "But that doesn't solve 
the problem entirely, does it?"
 He sighed. "You are quite right, 
Admiral. We still have among us a 
traitor who somehow managed to 
vaporize a Star Destroyer. We need to 
find the ones responsible, before the 
Rebels can claim credit for this 
heinous action. And by we, I mean?"
 "Me," she finished. "Do you think 
that wise? I should be getting back to 
my duties at the Maw."
 "They will keep. I need you here 
more than they do there."
 Daala nodded. "Well. I suppose that 
if it is my duty, what else is to be 
done?"
 She smiled. He returned it.
 "I'll start immediately," she said.
 Tarkin cleared his throat. "Perhaps 
not immediately. I seem to recall there 
were some other matters we intended 
to discuss."
 "In the privacy of your quarters?"
 He smiled again. "Just so."



THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DECK 69, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Teela Kaarz wasn't much of a 
drinker. Sure, she'd have a little wine 
with dinner, a social drink now and 
then, but she was too happy a drunk, 
too willing to go along with whatever 
anybody wanted just for the fun of it, 
and that had gotten her in trouble 
more than a couple of times. Better to 
stay sober than to have to deal with 
the regrets later? she had enough of 
those as it was.
 But here she was, in this cantina, 
listening to a young woman on the 
small stage playing a stringed 
instrument, something classical and 
quiet, barely audible over the sounds 
of people drinking, laughing, and 
talking. She was here because she had 
won a bet?one of the other architects 
had doubted her ability to redesign a 
dining hall to a specification change 
suddenly required because somebody 
had mistranslated a measurement 
system. Whereas the specs said the 
room's floor was to be nine hundred 
square meters, whoever had written 
the blueprint had somehow used the 
Trogan meter instead of the Imperial 
standard meter, and the difference 
could not be made to fit in the 
available space, since there was a 25 
percent variation in the measures.
 Back when she had been in school, 
such an error would have been 
unthinkable, but the relationship of 
academe to real construction was that 
of night to day. It happened all the 
time. Just last week an automated 
supply ship had plowed into a 
warehouse on Despayre, destroying 
the ship entirely and half the building 
it hit, because somebody had set the 
autopilot's deceleration speed to 
centimeters per second instead of 
meters. If you impact at a hundred 
times the velocity you're supposed to, 
it makes something of a difference.
 Vishnare, the architect who had 
proposed the bet, lifted his cup in 
salute, as did the other five people 
from her workgroup, and she raised 
her own cup in acknowledgment.
 A noisy group entered the cantina 
just then, drowning out whatever toast 
Vishnare had to offer, along with the 
music. Teela looked at the new 
arrivals: half a dozen human males all 
dressed in pilots' informals.
 She sipped a tiny bit of her drink and 
put the cup down. The pilots were 
loud, full of themselves, oozing 
overconfidence and arrogance. She 
had dated a former military pilot once 
who'd left the service and taken a job 
flying commercial transports on her 
homeworld, but he hadn't left the 
attitude behind. Look at me, it said, 
I'm so much better than everybody 
else. I can fly!
 That relationship hadn't lasted long. 
Being secure in what you did was a 
good thing, but being obnoxious 
about it? Not so much.
 The pilots took a table, and a droid 
went over to take their orders.
 Teela surreptitiously glanced at her 
chrono. She had to stay for a while 
more just to be polite, but since she 
wasn't much for small talk, mostly 
she'd just sit there and smile and nurse 
her drink until she could make an 
excuse and take off. She had some 
journals she wanted to read, and 
crowded, noisy rooms had never been 
her favorite spaces. She needed to go 
to the refresher, though, and while she 
preferred to do that in her own cube, 
when you had to go, you had to go.
 She smiled, stood, and worked her 
way toward the 'fresher.
 She was on her way back to her table 
when a large fellow wearing storage 
workers' greens decided he would 
give her an opportunity to enjoy his 
company. The man lurched to his feet 
and blocked her path. "Hey, 
sweetlook, wha's y'hurry? Lemme buy 
you a drink!" He was at least half 
soused, from the smell of his breath 
and his unsteady motion.
 "Thank you, but I already have a 
drink. I need to get back to my friends 
there." Teela nodded at her table, four 
meters past where the storageman 
wavered on unsteady feet.
 "Naw, naw, y'll'v much more fun 
here't my table, 'strue." He belched, 
and a rum-tainted miasma drifted past 
her nostrils.
 Teela was aware that she was not 
altogether unattractive, and over the 
years since puberty had resculpted her 
body, she had learned how to deal 
with unwanted attention well enough. 
Sometimes you could smile them 
away, sometimes you put a little steel 
in your voice, and most times you just 
flat out told them you weren't 
interested. Drunks didn't always get 
the subtle hints, so she went for 
direct: "Sorry. Not interested."
 She moved to go around him. He 
slid over and kept her route blocked. 
"Y'don' know what y're missin', 
sweetlook. I'm prime!"
 "Good for you. Tell somebody who 
cares." She turned, intending to go 
back the way she'd come and loop 
around?
 He grabbed her wrist as she started 
away. "Y'sayin' no t'we?" His tone 
was definitely less friendly now.
 Teela twisted her wrist, trying to pull 
free, knowing in advance that it would 
only serve to make the storageman 
hang on tighter. She was right.
 Conversation at the tables 
immediately surrounding them lagged 
as the patrons, mostly male and 
mostly as drunk as or drunker than her 
aspiring boyfriend, watched in bleary 
interest. The storageman was as large 
as he was drunk, which made him 
quite formidable. Teela stopped 
struggling, because at this stage that 
was what her assailant wanted. She 
had heard that the cantina's bouncer 
was fast and reliable. She hoped so, 
because she knew from past 
experience how quickly a situation 
like this could get really ugly . . . 
 "Oh, look," a man's voice said.
 Teela turned. It was one of the pilots. 
He looked about twenty-five, and he 
also looked like, if he worked out 
hard and ate his Flakies every 
morning, he might someday have a 
chest as big as the storageman's neck.
 Great, she thought. A hero. Where's 
the fripping bouncer?
 "Your shin hurts," the flyboy 
continued, smiling at the big drunk as 
guilelessly as a freshly decanted 
clone.
 The storageman frowned. "My 
what?"
 The pilot kicked, a short, low move, 
and the inside edge of his boot sole 
impacted the bigger man's lower leg, 
just below the knee. He scraped his 
foot down the bigger man's leg and 
stomped on the storage-man's instep.
 "Ow?feke?!"
 The pilot put his right hand on the 
big drunk's chest and shoved. Since 
the other was hopping on one foot, 
clutching his insulted leg and yelling, 
it took very little effort to move him 
backward, where he sat down heavily 
into his seat.
 Before he could do more than blink 
in bleary surprise, a very large man 
appeared as if by magic directly 
behind the storageman and laid a hand 
the size of a wampa's forepaw on the 
seated man's shoulder. "Is there a 
problem here?" he asked in a quiet 
voice. It was a pleasant voice, with no 
anger in it, but it nevertheless made 
Teela think of a sheath covering a 
razor's edge.
 "Nope," the pilot said. "Our friend 
here is a little over his limit, and felt 
unsteady on his feet. The lady and I 
were just helping him regain his seat 
safely."
 The bouncer standing behind the 
storageman smiled. "Ah. Well, then, 
enjoy the rest of your evening." He 
looked down at the befuddled 
storageman. "And you were just 
leaving, weren't you?"
 "Whuh?"
 "Nicely put. Let me help you to the 
exit."
 When they were gone, Teela said to 
the pilot, "I don't want to seem 
ungracious, but that wasn't 
necessary."
 "When a man lays unwanted hands 
on a woman, I believe it is. It's 
discourteous at best; brutality, at 
worst." He smiled. "I'm Lieutenant 
Vil Dance, by the way."
 She had to admit that his smile was 
attractive. Down, girl, she cautioned 
herself, but despite that she couldn't 
deny the tingling that had started in 
her stomach.
 "Teela Kaarz," she replied. "And I 
appreciate the sentiment, Lieutenant, 
even if I don't necessarily agree with 
it."
 "Appreciation, even without 
agreement, is certainly better than a 
poke in the eye. Would you allow me 
to buy you a drink?"
 "Thanks, but no. I'm not much of a 
drinker."
 "Me, neither, really. I'd rather be in 
my cube studying technical journals."
 "Really?"
 He grinned again. "Actually, no. But 
I'm hoping that if you believe I'm the 
serious sort, maybe you'll think better 
of me."
 His smile was infectious. Teela 
couldn't help smiling in return. "Does 
that work for you often?"
 "Pretending to be studious?"
 "No, pretending to give away your 
pickup line that way."
 Now he laughed. "Oh, I like a smart 
and funny fem." He dimmed the smile 
a little. "Let me buy you a caf or 
sucosa. Water, even. Sit and visit with 
me for a little while."
 "I don't know . . . " Which was a lie; 
she knew very well what she wanted 
to do. In her mind's eye, the small 
mental projection of her conscience 
and common sense gaped in disbelief. 
I can't believe you're seriously 
contemplating this, it scolded.
 "Come on. It's war, I'm a pilot, my 
number could be up any moment. 
Wouldn't you feel better knowing I 
went out to meet my end smiling at 
the memory of you?"
 You just barely escaped a dangerous 
situation with one man, her 
conscience avatar said, and here you 
are letting yourself be sugar-talked by 
another.
 Teela laughed at Dance's line. "You 
pilots and your platinum tongues. All 
right. I suppose it won't hurt 
anything."
 Her conscience threw up its hands in 
resignation and stalked off into the 
gray corridors of her brain.
 As they approached the table, she 
saw the other pilots look at them. 
More than a few looked twice, or 
closer, and all were blatantly 
impressed. They stood. "Hey, Vil," 
one of them said. "We have to shove 
off. See you back at the barracks."
 Dance eyed him. "You're sure about 
that?"
 "Oh, right. Um . . . " The flier was 
obviously uncomfortable, and the 
concealed smiles of the others, not to 
mention the glare he was getting from 
Dance, weren't making things any 
easier for him. "Right. We have to, uh 
. . .  go over our technical specs. 
Down in the hangar."
 The five pilots left. Teela gave 
Dance a measured look. "You had a 
bet going with your friends," she said. 
It was not a question.
 He shrugged. "Of course. First man 
back with a woman wins the table. 
They'll go see if the odds in the pub 
on Level Six are better. One doesn't 
need a bunch of comrades cramping 
his run if one gets lucky."
 "You aren't going to get that lucky, 
Lieutenant. Not tonight, anyway. "
 He flashed that high-wattage smile at 
her again. "You're too sharp for me, 
Teela Kaarz. I really like a woman 
who makes me have to stretch."
 She sighed. No way was she getting 
into anything remotely serious with a 
navy pilot. No way.
 But a cup of caf couldn't hurt . . .

THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DECK 69, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Memail Roothes was aware that she 
was?well, not to put too fine a point 
on it?primping. That was a bad sign, 
she knew, when she started to care 
what a new male thought of her 
appearance. The actions themselves 
didn't look like much: a slight 
adjustment of her posture, a little 
brush over the brow to smooth out a 
bit of makeup, a quick glance at her 
reflection when she passed a mirror to 
check her lekku positions. Nothing 
major. But she knew. She wanted to 
look good, and she wanted Ratua to 
notice that she did.
 She wasn't too old, ugly, or fat, and 
she wasn't stupid. He already did like 
her?you didn't run cantinas for as 
long as she had without being able to 
feel the heat come off a male when he 
looked at you. Still, the fluttery 
sensation she felt, the quickening of 
her heartbeat and breath? those were 
all bad signs. She didn't need a new 
complication in her life right now.
 And Green-Eyes was definitely that. 
For one thing, he didn't exist, 
according to what Rodo had found?
or hadn't found?in his HoloNet 
search, and that meant he was a bad 
boy of some kind. Could be a legal 
bad boy?a sub-rosa agent for the 
Empire, say. Or he could be a Rebel 
spy. Or some kind of criminal . . . 
 But he made her laugh, he was quick 
and clever, and those eyes . . . she'd 
never seen any quite that color before. 
They were like liquid emerald, bright 
and alert.
 Hence, the primping.
 At the end of the bar, a pair of CPOs 
were talking about a rumored prison 
break in the detention area. Memah 
overheard one of them say, "Way I 
heard it, nine guys broke out, one of 
them a Jedi."
 The other petty officer laughed. 
"Hate to point it out, but Jedi are real 
scarce these days."
 "Just telling the story, Tenn."
 "Yeah, I heard it, too. Only I heard it 
was fifty guys, all captured Rebels, 
led by five Jedi. And they took over 
the superlaser and started blasting Star 
Destroyers. 'Course, the big gun isn't 
even operational yet. Anyone knows 
that, it's me. But hey, why let facts get 
in the way of a good story?"
 The first chief laughed and sipped at 
his ale. "Sounds almost like a sim run, 
don't it? A really wacky sim run."
 The second CPO said, "Time this 
war's over, want to bet that story'll 
have a Rebel army nearly destroying 
the station? Every action I ever been 
in, stories like that pop up. One floob 
spits on the slidewalk, by the end of 
the cycle it's turned into a crack unit 
of Rebels knocking over a fortress."
 The first one laughed again. "Yeah. 
Next they'll be saying it took the Five 
Hundred and First to put 'em down."
 Both men laughed.
 Memah smiled. She had heard some 
of those stories, too. Why people felt 
the need to embellish the truth, or 
even fabricate something completely 
different, when reality was all too 
often quite fantastic enough, was 
light-years beyond her.
 She happened to be looking at the 
door when Ratua came ambling in as 
if he owned the place. He caught her 
glance, smiled, and headed for the 
bar. Once there, he looked her up and 
down in frank appreciation.
 "You," he said to her, "look like the 
reason the riot started."
 She realized to her astonishment that 
she was blushing. "Well," she replied, 
"you look like you could use a drink. 
What'll it be?"
 He laughed. "I'll have the unusual."
 "Which means what, exactly?"
 "Surprise me. Something exotic. 
Expensive enough to justify me sitting 
here and occupying your bar and 
attention."
 "I don't think we have anything 
worth that much."
 "You wound me. Right here." He put 
a hand over his heart, or at least where 
a human's heart would be. "Here I am, 
seeking sanctuary, trying to stay out 
of trouble?"
 Memah said, "I think you are 
trouble, Ratua. It would probably be 
much better for me if I stayed as far 
away from you as I could."
 "Probably," he agreed, in a more 
serious tone. "But where's the fun in 
that?"
 She built him a drink, a simple one, 
with a lot of alcohol and some 
sweeteners and colors. It was potent 
stuff. So far she'd never seen him 
drunk?at least, not so she could tell. 
Must have a hyperdrive metabolism, 
she thought.
 She put down his glass, then planted 
both hands on the pleekwood bar and 
leaned toward him. "Fun starts with 
the truth. Who are you?"
 He sighed, and didn't say anything 
for a couple of seconds. "I've always 
found truth to be highly overrated."
 "Nevertheless . . . "
 "Okay." He took a fortifying swig of 
his drink, then said, "I'm Celot Ratua 
Dil, second son of the First Counselor 
Nagat Keris Ratua and his Tertiary 
Wife, Feelah Derin. Of late, I resided 
on the planet Despayre, where I was 
incarcerated for a crime I actually did 
not commit?though in balance, I 
can't claim to be an upstanding 
citizen."
 "So you weren't kidding before?"
 "Nope."
 "What was the crime?"
 "Guilt by association. Wrong place, 
wrong time."
 "And how did you come to be here?"
 "I escaped."
 "Really. Just like that?"
 "Well, I won't bore you with the 
details?"
 "Oh, please?bore me. I so seldom 
find myself bored these days."
 "It doesn't bother you that I'm an 
escapee?"
 Memah stood back and folded her 
arms. "You were pretty sure it 
wouldn't, weren't you? Or you 
wouldn't have told me."
 "I was hoping. And you did demand 
the truth."
 "So I did. And I'm wondering when 
I'm going to get it."
 Ratua studied the drink for a 
moment, then looked up at her, and 
she had to physically tense up to resist 
the earnestness in those remarkable 
eyes. "Now, if you want it."
 "What have you done for which you 
might have deserved to be 
imprisoned?"
 "I was a smuggler. Among other 
things. Nothing violent."
 "That's good." She refilled his drink. 
He smiled into it, then at her.
 Smile and use those eyes as much as 
you want, she thought. If I have to 
turn you in, I will. "Think hard before 
you say anything more, Celot Ratua 
Dil. If you're guilty of any crimes 
against the Empire, then I could be 
endangering my cantina just by 
talking to you. You might want to 
turn around and walk out of here right 
now, because if your presence is a 
danger to me and my livelihood, 
you'll find out where this place got its 
name."
 He stared at her. "I believe you're the 
kind of person who'd do it."
 Memah nodded. "That I am."
 "Good," said Ratua. "If you weren't, 
I wouldn't be talking to you."

REC ROOM 17-A, DEATH STAR
 
 Sergeant Nova Stihl was tired. The 
fighting classes he taught weren't part 
of his regular duties, and now that 
word had gotten around he had four 
full sessions, with about twenty-five 
students per class. Each of these ran 
an hour and a half, and he had two 
sessions every evening after his shift 
ended. He didn't eat until after the 
second class, after which he would go 
back to his cube, shower, and hit the 
sleep pad.
 Such a schedule made for busy light 
and dark cycles.
 He kept himself in shape, but he 
hadn't been sleeping well. The bad 
dreams he'd sometimes had back on 
the prison planet had grown more 
frequent on the battle station, and 
some of them were extremely realistic 
and violent. More than a few times 
he'd come out of a sleep to find his 
heart pounding rapidly and his 
coverlets drenched in sweat.
 He didn't understand why it was 
happening. He had considered having 
medical run a check, to make sure 
there wasn't something amiss going 
on in his brain, but he kept hoping the 
sleep sorties would ease off. He'd give 
it a little more time, and then he 
would go see the medics, he told 
himself. Maybe there was something 
in the air, some trace element the 
filters weren't straining out.
 Besides, when did he have time to 
go see a doctor?
 Most of the students were rank 
beginners; even though some of them 
Could fight well enough, they had to 
learn the system of teras kasi to 
overlay what they already knew. 
There were reasoned patterns of 
movement, principles, laws, and these 
were more important than any 
particular technique. It didn't matter if 
you had a punch that would knock 
down a wall if you couldn't deliver it, 
and to do that, you needed a system 
that would allow it frequently.
 Even though his students were 
newbies, Nova always felt as if he 
learned as much from them as he 
taught. If you had to explain 
something to a being who knew 
nothing about it, you had to 
understand it pretty well. Sometimes 
words would come out of his mouth 
that he didn't expect?words that 
suddenly rang in a way that the 
essential truth just . . .  blossomed 
suddenly, like a desert flower after a 
sudden rain. Now and again he
