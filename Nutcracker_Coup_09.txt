Marianne also didn't have a job by the time she got back to the embassy.  Clarence had tried to clap her onto the returning supply ship, but Nick stepped in to announce that Clarence had no business sending anybody from his ethnology staff home.  In the end, Clarence's bureaucratic invective had failed him and the ethnologists simply disobeyed, as Nick had.  All Clarence could do, after all, was issue a directive; if they chose to ignore it, the blame no longer fell on Clarence.  Since that was all that worried Clarence, that was all right.

In the end, Marianne found that being an ethnologist was considerably more interesting than being a diplomat...especially during a revolution.

She and Nick, with Tatep, had taken time off from their mutual studies to choose this year's Christmas treeâ€”from Halemtat's reserve.  "Why," said Marianne, bemused at her own reaction, "do I feel like I'm cutting a Christmas tree with Thomas Jefferson?"

"Because you are," Nick said.  "Even Thomas Jefferson did ordinary things once in a while.  Chances are, he even hung out with his friends...."  He waved.  "Hi, Tatep.  How goes the revolution?"

For answer, Tatep rattled the length of his body.

"Good," said Nick.

"I may have good news to share with you at the Christmas party," added the Rejoicer.

"Then we look forward to the Christmas party even more than usual," said Marianne.

"And I brought a surprise for Marianne all the way from Dirt," Nick added.  When Marianne lifted an eyebrow, he said, "No, no hints."

"Share?" said Tatep.

"Christmas Eve," Nick told him.  "After you've shared your news, I think."
