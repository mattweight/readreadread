 Tarkin let out the breath he was 
holding.
 "But she sustained a head wound and 
is . . . disoriented. There is a piece of 
shrapnel in her skull. We need a 
surgeon."
 Tarkin nodded. "Get her to the 
station immediately."
 "We're on our way, sir, should be 
arriving in a few minutes."
 Tarkin broke the call, then activated 
the station intercom.
 Captain Hotise answered. "N-One 
MedCenter."
 "Admiral Daala has been injured in 
the attack and is on the way in with a 
head wound. Have your best team of 
surgeons standing by."
 "Yes, sir."
 Tarkin sundered the connection. This 
was not good news. It mitigated his 
triumph at the success of the 
superlaser's first firing. He did not 
want to lose Daala?that would sour 
the taste of victory.
 And of course, he did care for her . . 
.



A THOUSAND KILOMETERS OFF THE 
DEATH STAR
 
 The first wave of X-wings 
outnumbered the line of TIE fighters 
two to one, but they were flying 
nonevasive?hoping, Vil guessed, to 
blow right past the defenders.
 That wasn't going to happen. Vil 
targeted the first X-wing to get within 
range, fired, and blew it apart, just 
like that. The enemy pilot never got a 
pulse off.
 With zone defense, you moved 
around, but you held a certain position 
within specified limits. The X-wings 
were trying to get past, not engage. 
They shot if a TIE was right in front 
of them to clear a path, but they didn't 
deviate from their trajectories. They 
were intent on the Death Star. That 
made them easy targets.
 What kind of lunatic strategy was 
that?
 Vil quickly took out a second ship, 
then a third.
 Behind him, the battle station had 
scrambled more TIE ships, and 
behind the X-wings the Star 
Destroyers were sending out even 
more. Very soon the odds would be 
even, if not in the Empire's favor.
 The flight commander's voice 
crackled in his ears: "Alpha One, Beta 
One, Gamma One, Delta One?break 
zone and pursue, targets of 
opportunity!"
 Drolan intended for his units to 
collect as many of the kills as 
possible, Vil knew. The next wave 
would stop any who got past, but 
folks late to the game weren't going to 
have anything to shoot at when they 
got here.
 Vil shrugged. If the Rebels were 
intent on suicide, then his men would 
be glad to oblige them. He blipped his 
squad: "Alpha One, you heard the 
man. Fan out and take 'em apart! Ten-
klick global pattern; don't get too far 
away."
 He heard the chorus of "Copy, 
Lieutenant!" as he pulled his TIE 
around and started chasing the X-
wings.
 It wasn't a battle; it was a massacre. 
The X-wings were so intent on hitting 
the station that they didn't fight back. 
The eighty or so that Vil's wave 
couldn't collect were cut to pieces by 
the next wave of TIEs coming from 
the Death Star. The second wave of 
X-wings didn't get a single fighter 
past the Star Destroyers' TIE 
squadrons.
 When it was done, Vil had ten kills, 
duly recorded by his nose cam and 
logged into his file.
 Five kills made you an ace. Just like 
that, Lieutenant Dance had become a 
double ace, as had more than a few 
others. The total number of TIE 
fighters lost was fewer than a 
hundred.
 It had been his first real battle 
against the Rebels, but Vil took no 
pride in it. It had been easy.
 Far too easy.

COMMAND CENTER, OVERBRIDGE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 "Sir?" Motti said. "You heard me, 
Admiral. We are moving the station. 
The Rebels knew where to find us, 
and I won't allow that to happen 
again."
 Tarkin had that look on his face that 
brooked no argument. It was a look 
that Motti knew well. Nevertheless, it 
was his duty to point out 
impediments. "Sir, we aren't really 
ready for full lightspeed maneuvers 
yet."
 The Grand Moff looked impatient. "I 
know, Admiral. We don't need to go 
far; the other side of Despayre will do 
for now. The Rebels will know that 
their attempt failed, so they won't try 
the same tactic again. No one but the 
commanders of the Star Destroyers 
and their chief navigators are to be 
given the new coordinates?and aside 
from you and our chief navigator and 
myself, no one else on this station is 
to be given that information, either. 
There are spies among us, Admiral, 
and while we will eventually hunt 
them down and remove them, I will 
not risk this station in the meantime. 
Understand?"
 "Yes, sir, I do."
 "Within the hour, Motti. Leave two 
Star Destroyers here."
 "By your command, sir."
 Tarkin turned away. "I'm going to 
Medical. Admiral Daala's surgery is 
in progress."
 After Tarkin was gone, Motti 
considered his task. It made sense to 
move, there was no questioning that. 
If a Rebel armada showed up and 
there was nobody there . . . well, it 
was a big galaxy. They wouldn't know 
where to start looking, and it likely 
wouldn't occur to any of them that 
their enemies had gone to all the 
trouble of powering up just to lumber 
around to the other side of the planet. 
Every additional hour it took for them 
to locate the Death Star would be one 
more hour closer to it becoming fully 
operational.
 And once that happened, the entire 
Rebel fleet would be powerless to 
stop it.
 That the Grand Moff's paramour was 
injured was too bad, but hardly any of 
Motti's concern. He held little respect 
for her as an officer. Without Tarkin's 
patronage, she would never have risen 
to her rank. As far as he was 
concerned, women didn't have what it 
took to command. If she died on the 
operating table, Motti would shed no 
real tears, though he would, of course, 
pretend sadness to keep Tarkin 
mollified. The old man was a bit 
touchy about her, and it wasn't a good 
idea to get on his bad side. Daala was 
a distraction; Tarkin cared for her too 
much. That was another chink in the 
Grand Moff's armor, a chink that 
someday Motti might want to exploit.



SURGICAL SUITE 1, MEDCENTER, 
DEATH CENTER
 
 Uli was not a neurosurgeon by 
specialty, but he had learned a great 
deal about the subject by necessity in 
operating theaters all over the war-
torn galaxy. He'd lost count of the 
number of hands-on neurosurgical 
procedures he had done, and he 
couldn't even begin to estimate the 
number of species he had operated 
upon. If you were the only surgeon 
available, you cut what needed to be 
cut.
 He was not the primary on this case, 
only one of the three-person team of 
surgeons digging into the admiral's 
head. The stakes, as they were keenly 
aware, were very high. She was the 
only woman admiral in the Imperial 
Navy, and she was, according to the 
scut, Grand Moff Tarkin's very 
personal friend. It was not beyond 
possibility that if she didn't make it 
through the procedure, the Grand 
Moff might have them all shoved 
through the nearest lock into 
unforgiving space.
 There were seven more surgical 
assistants in the room?three nurses 
and four droids. So far the operation 
was going well. All vital signs were 
good.
 "Okay, we are removing the artifact 
now." That was from Abu Banu, the 
station's only real neurosurgeon. He 
was a Cerean, one of the few 
nonhuman species in any position of 
authority aboard the Death Star? no 
doubt because he was one of the best 
brain surgeons in the galaxy.
 "Stand by the pressor field in case 
we get a bleeder," Banu said.
 Uli, who was running the field, 
nodded, but he didn't need to be 
reminded. They all knew their jobs; 
Banu was talking for the recorder that 
was taking it all down. On a high-
profile procedure like this, if 
something happened, somebody 
would get blamed, and the recording 
would help pin it down. Sometimes 
patients died who should have lived, 
but you didn't want to be the man held 
responsible for allowing the Grand 
Moff's lover to expire.
 No pressure . . .
 A small blood vessel began to ooze, 
and Uli dialed the pressor field up a 
hair?enough to stop the seepage, but 
not enough to put too much pressure 
on the naked brain upon which they 
were working.
 "Sponge," Banu said.
 One of the droids extended a rock-
steady arm and blotted the tiny bit of 
blood that the pressor hadn't stopped.
 "Roa, dab a little glue on that 
arteriole."
 Dr. Roa reached in with the 
applicator's ultrafine tip and touched 
the torn vessel. A tiny bead of 
orthostat solution welled, flowed into 
the cut, and sealed it.
 "Got it," Roa said.
 Banu straightened, and Uli heard his 
spine crack. No surprise there; 
Cereans were notorious for back 
trouble. It was the price paid for those 
huge craniums they carried around.
 "Okay, crew, what do we think 
here?" Banu asked. "Uli?"
 "The shrapnel went into the 
hippocampus and adjacent cortex, 
mostly dentate gyrus. Not much in the 
Cornu Ammonis fields, or the 
subiculum, but even so, I'd guess she's 
going to have some memory 
problems. Old ones, maybe making 
new ones."
 "Dr. Roa?"
 "I'm with Divini. Stick a piece of 
jagged, hot metal into CA-one, CA-
two, and CA-three, wiggle it around, 
and you've got definite declarative 
memory loss. Can't tell how much or 
how bad."
 Banu nodded. "I concur. Given the 
injury, I don't see any problems with 
general cognitive function, but 
expressive and factual material will 
likely be compromised.
 "Anybody see anything else we need 
to fix?"
 Nobody did.
 "All right. Let's close her up."
 
 
 
 Uli was degowning in the post-op 
changing room with the other two 
surgeons and the assistants when 
Grand Moff Tarkin strode in. Uli's 
first thought was, He's not supposed 
to be here. But?who was going to 
tell him that?
 "Doctors. What is Admiral Daala's 
condition?"
 Uli and Roa looked at Banu. He was 
the head of the team, so it fell to him 
to explain it.
 "Sir," the Cerean said, "Admiral 
Daala sustained a neurological injury 
that chiefly impacted her right medial 
temporal lobe. She's in good condition 
and stable."
 "What long-term damage will there 
be to her?"
 "We can't be sure yet. That portion 
of the brain is called the 
hippocampus?humans have two 
hippocampi, one on each side. This 
area is, in large measure, responsible 
for functions of memory."
 Tarkin looked impatient. "Yes. 
And?"
 Banu looked at Uli and Roa, then 
back at Tarkin. "It's all conjecture at 
this point, sir. She is in a medically 
induced coma, so that we may treat 
her properly to prevent swelling of 
her injured brain. When she wakes up 
and recovers, the chances are good 
that there will be no loss of function, 
either neurologically or physically; 
however, there will likely be some 
memory loss."
 "Some? How much is some?"
 Banu shook his head. "We are not 
fortune-tellers, Governor. We won't 
know until the admiral recovers 
consciousness and can be tested."
 Tarkin's face clouded, and Banu 
apparently saw it. The Cerean 
hurriedly added, "If I had to guess, I'd 
say she won't remember the traumatic 
event, and that she'll likely lose at 
least some of the past year."
 "I see. Well. Keep me informed. 
Admiral Daala is a valuable officer."
 "Of course."
 Tarkin turned and left.
 "A valuable officer," Roa said. He 
chuckled. "I heard that she can?"
 "Ease up on that," Uli said. "Don't 
know who's listening."
 That sobered all three of them, and 
with good reason, Uli knew. You 
didn't want to be making jokes about 
the Grand Moff's girlfriend and have 
it get back to him. Not if you didn't 
want to wind up with your organs 
harvested.



CORRIDOR, OVERBRIDGE, DEATH 
STAR
 
 As he headed back to the Command 
Center, Tarkin was both relieved and 
worried. He felt great affection for 
Daala, to be sure, and he was most 
pleased that she would survive. That 
she might not recall her most recent 
visits here and their enjoyable time 
together was regrettable, but 
considering the possibility that her 
injury could well have killed her, not 
so bad.
 It was not so good, though, that 
whatever she had learned during her 
investigation of the spies in their 
midst would also likely be gone. 
Since she had never been here, 
officially, there would not be any files 
tucked away where that data might be 
found. She was too smart for that.
 And it was not the least bit good that 
she was here and injured, since she 
was supposed to be at the Maw. That 
would have to be addressed.
 As he walked, Tarkin considered his 
options. He needed to manage this in 
a way that would not come back to 
haunt him. He had not gotten to where 
he was by pretending politics did not 
exist. He had enemies, and they 
would glory in anything that might 
present him in a bad light to the 
Emperor.
 Daala would recover swiftly; she 
was young and strong. As soon as she 
was sufficiently well to travel, he 
would have her transferred back to the 
Maw. A story would be put in place?
an accident there had caused her some 
injury. She would go along with that, 
since her coming to see him would 
look as bad for her as it did for him. 
Travel logs could be adjusted, and 
there wouldn't be any official record 
that she had ever been here, much less 
wounded in an action against the 
Rebels.
 And if she didn't remember it, well, 
not to be hard-hearted, but perhaps 
that was for the best. Even a truth-
scan couldn't find a contradiction if 
the person undergoing it didn't know 
it had happened. Regrettable, yes, but 
one had to make the best of bad 
situations and, by so doing, keep them 
from getting worse. He could fill her 
in later, once the war was over and 
things had settled down. For now he 
did not need anybody looking at him 
askance?not this close to having the 
station completed and about to begin 
its mission. That simply would not do.
 His decision made, he felt better. 
Daala would not blame him in the 
least?she would do as much, were 
she in his place. Tarkin was sure of 
that.

 ISD DEVASTATOR, OFF 
PLANETTATOOINE, ARKANIS SECTOR, 
WILD SPACE
 
 "Lord Vader, the blockade-runner is 
in range. Should we open fire?" 
"Yes?but do not destroy her. Target 
the drives and control systems?I 
want the passengers and crew alive. 
Once we have disabled them, we will 
capture and board the ship."
 "Yes, my lord."
 The captain returned to his business, 
and Vader moved to stand in front of 
the forward viewports to watch the 
fleeing vessel. It was critical that he 
prevent the plans for the battle station 
from falling into the Rebels' 
clutches?and while he was at it, he 
would find out where they were being 
taken. Princess Leia Organa was at 
the core of this operation, and she 
would divulge what he needed to 
know?of that he had no doubt. Her 
mind might be resistant to persuasion 
by the Force, but there were other 
ways.
 The Rebel ship was no match for 
Vader's Destroyer, either in speed or 
firepower. In a matter of moments the 
drives and control had been crippled 
by laser strikes of surgical accuracy, 
their main reactor shut down, and a 
tractor beam from the Devastator 
generated to envelop the fleeing 
blockade-runner.
 The Tantive IV was drawn 
inexorably into the Destroyer's main 
cargo hold, gripped tightly in a 
pressor field that would jam any 
attempts by the Rebel crew to blow up 
the captured ship. Vader doubted they 
were that desperate, but he wasn't 
going to take the chance.
 An assault commander arrived. 
"Lord Vader, we have entry teams 
breaching the ship locks."
 "Good." Vader turned away from the 
viewport. "Come with me," he told 
the commander.
 The Tantive IV rested in the middle 
of the huge hold, looking small and 
defenseless, her white exterior marred 
by the scorched and blackened areas 
on the engines. Vader, followed by 
several stormtroopers, strode up the 
ramp to the air lock. The lock's hatch 
had been shattered moments before; 
clouds of vaporized sealant, paint, and 
metal still hung in the air. He stepped 
through the smoke into the corridor 
and surveyed the damage. The bodies 
of both Rebel defenders and 
stormtroopers littered the deck of the 
blockade-runner. Vader paused to 
look at one of the Rebels crumpled at 
his feet, then at a second. They had 
been brave. Foolish, since there was 
no escape and no chance of victory, 
but brave.
 Little good it would do them.
 The sounds of blasterfire still echoed 
throughout the small ship; now and 
then a stray bolt was deflected from a 
bulkhead and across a cross corridor, 
the flash of red reflecting fleetingly 
off the white walls. Vader was not 
worried about stray fire?he could 
concentrate the Force enough to stop 
a blaster's beam with the upraised 
palm of his gloved hand, if it came to 
that.
 The conclusion was foregone?the 
Rebels could not possibly win against 
such overwhelming odds, and they 
had to know that. Why fight on?
 There was some purpose to their 
continued resistance, of that he was 
sure. What was it?
 Vader and his escort moved through 
the ship's corridors, continuing his 
inspection. Some of the Rebel fighters 
had been captured, although most had 
gone down firing.
 Enough of this. Vader stopped and, 
with a gesture to the commander, 
indicated that they bring him a Rebel 
officer who had just been captured. In 
another moment the man stood before 
him, still under guard. Without 
preamble, Vader reached out and 
grabbed the officer by the throat, 
easily lifting him clear off the floor. 
He gasped and struggled, but in vain, 
of course. None could escape the grip 
of the Force.
 Before Vader could speak, a 
stormtrooper approached. He said, 
"The Death Star plans are not in the 
main computer."
 "Where are those transmissions you 
intercepted?" Vader asked him. "What 
have you done with those plans?"
 The officer struggled. "We 
intercepted no transmissions!" he 
croaked.
 Vader tightened his grip on the 
man's throat, lifting him higher. The 
officer's half-strangled words could 
barely be understood: "Aaah! This is . 
. . uhh ... a consular ship. We're on a 
diplomatic . . . agh! mission!"
 Vader was not impressed by this 
pathetic attempt at deception. "If this 
is a consular ship, where is the 
ambassador?"
 It was a rhetorical question. The man 
was not going to be helpful, so no 
more time needed to be wasted on 
him. Vader crushed his throat and 
tossed him across the corridor. The 
body bounced off the bulkhead and 
sprawled on the deck.
 He could sense the reactions of the 
other nearby prisoners without having 
to look. Another object lesson: thwart 
Lord Vader and such would be your 
reward as well.
 He turned to the assault leader. 
"Commander, tear this ship apart until 
you've found those plans. And bring 
me the passengers?I want them 
alive!"
 Vader smiled under his helmet as a 
file of stormtroopers arrived with Leia 
Organa in tow. It was reported that 
she had shot a trooper before they 
stunned her. It was hard to think of 
her showing such bravery?she was 
so young, so beautiful, dressed in that 
simple white gown. She reminded 
him very much of . . .
 No. He would not allow that 
thought.
 She glared at him, managing to look 
disdainful even though her hands 
were cuffed. "Darth Vader," she said, 
making no effort to hide her 
contempt. "Only you could be so 
bold. The Imperial Senate will not sit 
still for this?when they hear you've 
attacked a diplomatic?"
 He cut her off: "Don't act so 
surprised, Your Highness. You 
weren't on any mercy mission this 
time. Several transmissions were 
beamed to this ship by Rebel spies. I 
want to know what happened to the 
plans they sent you."
 She kept to her role: "I don't know 
what you're talking about. I'm a 
member of the Imperial Senate on a 
diplomatic mission to Alderaan?"
 Vader's patience was abruptly at an 
end. "You are part of the Rebel 
Alliance and a traitor!" He gestured 
furiously at the guards. "Take her 
away!"
 After she was hustled off, Vader 
stood motionless, quelling his rage. 
Anger could be useful, but only when 
it was anger you brought forth on 
your own, shaped to your ends. Not 
when it was provoked by someone 
else.
 He was somewhat surprised by the 
intensity of his response. There was 
something about her he could not 
quite put a finger on, something 
unusual. It troubled him. Organa's 
mind was not weak; this he could tell 
even after a cursory attempt to probe 
it. And there was something oddly 
familiar about her, something just 
outside his grasp . . .
 He mentally shrugged it off. It was 
not important. She would be dead 
soon in any event; Tarkin had signed 
the order already. It was only a matter 
of how much useful information they 
could pry from her before that came 
to pass. She was part of the past. He 
had the future with which he must 
deal.
 He began to walk as he considered 
his next move.
 Next to him the commander said, 
"Holding her is dangerous. If word 
gets out, it could generate sympathy 
for the Rebellion in the Senate."
 Vader wasn't moved by such fears. 
"I have traced the Rebel spies to her. 
Now she is my only link to finding 
their secret base."
 "She'll die before she'll tell you 
anything."
 "Leave that to me. Send a distress 
signal, then inform the Senate that all 
aboard were killed."
 Another Imperial officer approached 
them. "Lord Vader, the battle station 
plans are not aboard this ship. And no 
transmissions were made."
 Vader stared at the officer. His anger 
started to burn again.
 The officer seemed to sense this. 
Hurriedly, he added, "An escape pod 
was jettisoned during the fighting?
but no life-forms were aboard."
 Ah. So that was why they had 
continued to resist?to give their 
precious Princess time to physically 
remove the plans. Of course. He 
turned to the commander. "She must 
have hidden the plans in the escape 
pod. Send a detachment down to 
retrieve them. See to it personally, 
Commander. There'll be no one to 
stop us this time."
 "Yes, sir."
 Vader strode through the lock and 
back into his ship's cargo bay. At the 
least, they had prevented the Princess 
from delivering the Death Star plans 
to the Rebels. Imperial troopers would 
recover them?and even if they did 
not, there was little damage they 
could do on the worthless desert 
world of Tatooine. There was nothing 
of value on that world. Nothing at all.

THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DECK 69, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Behind the bar, the liquor bottles 
rattled on their shelves, and Memah 
felt a gentle but insistent thrum under 
her feet.
 "What?" she began.
 "We're moving," Rodo said.
 Next to him, Nova nodded. 
"Sublight engines, so we aren't going 
far."
 The customers?about a quarter 
capacity this time of cycle?paused 
for a few seconds, then went back to 
what they were doing. Nobody 
seemed too perturbed by the event.
 "Why are we moving? Construction 
isn't finished yet," she said. "Is it?"
 "Apparently enough so that the ship 
can be relocated," Rodo said.
 After a moment, the vibration 
evened out. The bottles stopped 
jittering. The hum quieted and 
became very faint, barely felt.
 Memah turned to Nova. "What does 
this mean, Sarge?"
 He laughed. "Oh, right, me being so 
critical to the running of the station, 
the Moff called me up and gave me a 
personal briefing just a minute ago on 
my comlink. Didn't you notice?"
 Rodo said, "I don't believe I'm 
giving away any military secrets when 
I say it probably has to do with the 
battle we just fought."
 She looked at him. "What battle?"
 Rodo shrugged. "Don't know for 
sure, but a couple of things just 
happened that kind of hint at one. 
Several wings of TIE fighters 
suddenly decided to leave the station, 
more than a thousand ships, and 
shortly thereafter you might recall that 
the lights dimmed for a couple of 
seconds? My guess is the power 
capacitors that fill up a big chunk of 
this big metal ball got diverted to that 
big honkin' gun."
 "How come you know stuff like 
this?" Nova said.
 "How come you don't?"
 "I didn't say I didn't know it."
 Memah said, "So is Rodo right?"
 Now it was Nova's turn to shrug. 
"He's not wrong. Word I got was that 
a Rebel carrier ship popped out of 
hyper a couple of thousand klicks 
away and kicked out a load of X-
wings, presumably to come and shoot 
at us. According to my source, they 
turned the superlaser at the carrier and 
blew it all the way back to Imperial 
Center."
 She blinked in astonishment. "It's 
that powerful?"
 Nova said, "Oh, yeah. A ship is 
nothing. The power to the beam was 
only in the single digits?cranked up 
full, anything within half a million 
klicks isn't safe, including asteroids, 
moons, even planets."
 "No!"
 "Yes. Why else would they spend all 
that time and money on this"? he 
swung one arm to encompass the 
entirety of their surroundings?"if it 
couldn't produce some major damage? 
Why else would they call it 'the Death 
Star'?"
 "It's hard to imagine," she said.
 "For you. For me, even. Not for the 
Imperial high-level mucks who get 
paid to come up with such things. 
What I heard, this thing's been in 
development, in one form or another, 
for years. And once it starts 
rampaging through the galaxy, the 
Rebellion's crisp. If Tarkin even 
thinks there's a Rebel base on a planet 
or a moon?" Nova moved both 
hands in a motion simulating the 
flowering of an explosion. "Boom. 
End of base, end of problem. Two or 
three worlds go up in a flash like that, 
and the war's over. Who would risk 
losing billions or even trillions of 
people to hide a few insurrectionists? 
It'll be all finished except for the 
bands and the medals."
 "You think?" Rodo asked.
 "No question. Maybe when my tour 
is done, I'll open up a school 
somewhere quiet, maybe out in one of 
the arms, settle down, even have a 
few kids, because war as we know it 
won't happen with things like this"?
he patted the bar top gently a couple 
of times?"flying around. Build a few 
more of 'em, you won't need armies or 
navies or planet-bound military bases. 
You get a hot spot, some systems get 
cranky, you send a Death Star, and 
it'll be game over."
