longer. "Any attack made by the 
Rebels against this station would be a 
useless gesture, no matter what 
technical data they've obtained. This 
station is now the ultimate power in 
the universe. I suggest we use it."
 Vader said, "Don't be too proud of 
this technological terror you've 
constructed. The ability to destroy a 
planet is insignificant next to the 
power of the Force."
 Motti wanted to laugh. Vader had to 
be insane! How could he say that, 
especially with the rubble of Despayre 
still sweeping past the station? "Don't 
try to frighten us with your sorcerer's 
ways, Lord Vader," he said, feeling 
safe in the presence of witnesses. He 
was aware that Vader was moving 
toward him, but Motti was committed. 
Even knowing what a bad idea it was 
to bait the man in black, he continued: 
"Your sad devotion to that ancient 
religion has not helped you conjure up 
the stolen data tapes or given you 
clairvoyance enough to find the 
Rebels' hidden fort?ukk!"
 Three meters away, Vader leaned 
forward and made a small motion 
with his hand, closing it into a fist.
 Motti felt his throat clench and close 
up, as if it were being crushed by a 
steel clamp. He . . . couldn't. . . 
breathe . . . !
 He dug his fingers into his collar, 
trying to remove what felt like an 
unbreakable band around his neck. It 
didn't work. The pressure was there, 
but there was nothing material around 
his throat to cause it.
 "I find your lack of faith disturbing," 
Vader said.
 Motti felt himself start to gray out. 
He wanted to scream, but he could not 
utter so much as a squeak as he slid 
toward the abyss of unconsciousness 
and death . . .
 He barely heard Tarkin speak. 
"Enough of this. Vader?release 
him."
 "As you wish," Vader said. He 
turned and strode away, and a 
moment later Motti fell forward onto 
the conference table, not feeling the 
impact. He could breathe again, 
however. The constriction was gone. 
He sat up, filled with rage, and glared 
at Vader. If only he had a blaster!
 But, though he was not a cowardly 
man, his rage was tinged with fear. 
How had Vader done that? He had 
been three meters away.
 Motti swallowed, his mouth dry, his 
throat sore.
 Tarkin said, "This bickering is 
pointless. Lord Vader will provide us 
with the location of the Rebel fortress 
by the time this station is operational. 
We will then crush the Rebellion with 
one swift stroke!"
 Motti believed that. But he also 
knew something else now, too. Vader 
had power, and it was real. Motti had 
felt it, and, if Tarkin had not 
intervened, he believed with every 
fiber of his being that he would be 
dead.
 That was a sobering thought. What 
did it matter if you commanded a 
station that could destroy a world if 
you could be killed yourself by a 
freak waving a hand in the air?
 Something would have to be done 
about Vader. But very, very carefully 
done.

PRISON BLOCK AA, DETENTION 
CENTER, DEATH STAR
 Uli had just completed his rounds, 
which included a quick tour of a 
different prison block every cycle. 
Most of the prisoners were there for 
minor infractions, drunk-and-
disorderlies and the like. He was in 
the corridor, heading to his office 
when he saw none other than Darth 
Vader coming from the other 
direction.
 With him was a beautiful young 
woman.
 It was such a surreal sight that he 
was momentarily tempted to question 
his senses. But it was real enough; he 
could see the fluorescents' distorted 
reflections slide along the black 
helmet as Vader walked, and could 
hear the regulated breathing of the 
man's respiratory apparatus. The 
sound of his boots against the floor 
grating was oddly soft for so large a 
man.
 Vader had one hand clamped on the 
woman's upper arm, and even from 
ten meters away Uli could see by her 
expression of pain and anger that the 
grip was hard enough to be hurting 
her. Whoever she was, she was 
obviously not with Vader by choice.
 The woman wore a white gown, and 
she looked somehow familiar, 
although he couldn't place her. Her 
dark brown hair was long, but rolled 
into tight circles against the sides of 
her head. Even through the discomfort 
and indignity of her situation, she 
seemed extraordinarily self-possessed.
 The three of them were alone in the 
prison block corridor. As Uli drew 
near, Vader stopped. Paying no 
attention to the doctor, he opened one 
of the cells and pushed the woman 
unceremoniously inside. The hatch 
dropped shut behind her.
 Uli had slowed and glanced back 
over his shoulder to watch as he 
passed. After incarcerating the 
woman, Vader turned, ebony cape 
flaring behind him. He looked back at 
Uli. Although no part of his face was 
visible, Uli somehow had no doubt 
that Vader was looking directly at 
him.
 He set his gaze in front of him once 
more and continued walking. Just as 
he exited the block, three black-clad 
and helmeted technicians passed him. 
Behind them, floating on a cushion of 
repulsorlift energy, an interrogator 
droid followed.
 Uli took the lift back to Medical, 
wondering who the woman was and 
what her crime had been. The lift 
doors opened and he started up the 
corridor, but stopped as C-4ME-0 
wheeled around the corner.
 "Good after-midday, Dr. Divini."
 "Not for everyone, it appears. I just 
saw Darth Vader, of all people, 
apparently intending to interrogate a 
young woman in the prison block. Do 
you know who she is?"
 "Princess Leia Organa, a member of 
the Imperial Senate, from Alder-aan. 
It is said that she is also a sympathizer 
with the Rebel Alliance. Apparently 
she has information the Empire wants, 
and thus her impending interrogation 
by Lord Vader."
 Uli winced at the thought. 
Interrogation technology was 
imprecise, more brute force than 
finesse?intentionally so, for the most 
part. Many prisoners started talking a 
klick a minute at the first sight of one 
of those glossy-black ISB globes, 
bristling with archaic hypodermic 
syringes and electrodes. And woe to 
them if they didn't, because the term 
interrogator droid was just a 
euphemism for its real function. It 
was a torture device, purely and 
simply. Many who underwent 
examination by the probes were 
mentally or even physically damaged 
beyond repair.
 A harsh fate for such a lovely and 
brave young woman as this Princess 
apparently was. He had seen only a 
hint of fear in her as she passed; that 
she was willing to resist Vader to the 
extent of requiring such extreme 
measures indicated a fortitude Uli 
doubted that he himself possessed.
 He was outraged by the thought of 
such barbarism being practiced by the 
Empire, although not particularly 
surprised. But he knew there was 
nothing to be done about it. To protest 
the actions of the Emperor's whip 
would do her absolutely no good, and 
no doubt result in his own immediate 
imprisonment. He could finally get 
his discharge from the medical wing 
of the Imperial Navy, although it 
would likely be a discharge from this 
plane of existence as well. He shook 
his head and looked at 4ME-0. "Were 
you looking for me?"
 "Indeed. Dr. Hotise wishes to 
discuss the overages in last month's 
supply budget with you."
 Uli nearly groaned aloud, but the 
thought of the young woman in the 
cell made him feel somewhat 
ashamed of himself. She was facing 
far more than a bureaucratic 
upbraiding about expenditures.
 He followed the droid around the 
corner. What a shame. She was so 
young, so lovely. She reminded him, 
somehow, of Barriss.




CELL 2187, BLOCK AA, DETENTION 
LEVEL, DEATH STAR
 
 Vader, accompanied by three black-
clad and helmeted technicians, 
entered the cell where Leia Organa 
was being held. He had hoped that she 
would have become more tractable 
after her capture. But she had 
remained silent. Her choice. She 
would regret it.
 Behind him the interrogator droid 
followed. It was a crude tool, a blunt 
instrument compared with the subtlety 
and precision possible with the Force; 
however, Princess Leia's mind was 
too strong to easily manipulate, even 
with the power of the dark side at his 
beck and call. It was possible that he 
could wrest the knowledge from her, 
but he might end up destroying the 
very information he sought. She 
would force him to bum her brain to a 
husk before she would willingly part 
with the data?of that he had no 
doubt.
 However, after being subjected to 
the tender mercies of the device 
floating behind him for a time, her 
mind should be a bit more . . . pliable.
 Now and then, one had to make do 
with the tools available, however 
crude they might be.
 The chamber's door slid up, 
revealing the Princess sitting on a 
platform in the mostly bare room. 
Vader and two of the techs entered. 
The third waited outside in the 
corridor.
 "And now, Your Highness, we will 
discuss the location of your hidden 
Rebel base," Vader told her.
 As the interrogator droid floated in 
behind him, Vader saw her defiant 
expression falter. He felt her fear as 
the machine approached her.
 Good . . .
 He heard the door slam down behind 
them.
 But, after half an hour, despite the 
truth drugs, electrical shocks, and 
other inducements he had 
administered, it was evident that her 
resistance had not been lowered 
enough for him to probe her mind. 
That was surprising.
 She was physically weakened and in 
considerable pain, but her mind 
remained shielded. She had revealed 
nothing.
 Most unusual for anyone except a 
Jedi to have such control, he mused.
 He kept his anger and frustration 
under tight rein, letting none of it 
show. He had other matters that 
required his attention?for now.
 "We are not done here," he told her. 
To one of the technicians he said, 
"Have a medic attend to her."
 The technician said, "But isn't she 
sentenced to die?"
 "When I decide it is time," Vader 
said. "If she is not alive and well until 
that moment, I will hold you 
personally responsible."
 The tech grew visibly paler. Vader 
swept by him and out of the chamber.



MEDCENTER, DEATH STAR
 
 Uli couldn't stop thinking about the 
imprisoned Princess. Something about 
her touched him, somehow.
 As he left Hotise's office, he told 
himself that there was no point in 
thinking about her. Most likely she 
was already dead by now, another 
casualty of war, like the millions of 
people destroyed along with the 
prison planet.
 "You there!" a man's voice called 
loudly.
 Uli turned and saw an interrogation 
tech standing down the hall. "Are you 
the medic on duty?"
 "I'm Dr. Divini, yes."
 "I have a patient for you. This way, 
quickly."
 Uli followed the tech back up to the 
prison level. Vader was gone, along 
with the interrogation droid, but their 
work was evident. The Princess lay on 
the cell's platform in no small amount 
of distress.
 Uli passed his hand over the cell's 
reader and said, "EM kit!"
 The reader recognized his ID. A slot 
in the wall opened, and a drawer 
containing a full emergency medical 
kit extruded. He grabbed a handheld 
diagnoster from it and moved to the 
supine woman. He pressed the sensor 
against her bare shoulder and watched 
as the readout's infocrawl began.
 Her eyelids fluttered, then opened. 
She gave him a faint smile. "Pardon 
me if I don't get up, Doctor. I'm 
feeling a bit tired."
 He gave her an automatic smile 
back. "Sorry," he said. "I'll do what I 
can to help you."
 "First time I've heard that in a 
while."
 "Just relax and I'll take care of 
things."
 "I've heard that one before, too."
 Despite the gravity of the situation, 
Uli grinned. He had to admire the 
woman. Pumped full of chem and 
suffering from electrical shocks and 
who knew what else, and she was still 
able to joke. If she was an example of 
the Rebels' mettle, the Empire wasn't 
going to win this war anytime soon.



THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Generally, the atmosphere in the 
place was, at the least, festive. Today, 
however, the mood was subdued. 
Ratua sat at the bar watching Memah 
make drinks, and neither of them was 
happy. She went through the motions, 
but he knew her mind was not on her 
task. They had recently witnessed the 
death of a planet, an act committed by 
the huge weapon upon which they 
lived. Whatever one's politics, it had 
been a sobering, nightmarish sight. 
What kind of monster could order 
such an atrocity, could cause the 
destruction of an entire world?
 A world that, had Ratua not 
managed to escape, would have taken 
him with it, along with the millions of 
other lives cut short in panic and 
agony.
 They weren't the only ones who had 
seen it, and for something of this 
magnitude, word spread quickly. It 
was true that the Death Star had been 
built with the capability to commit 
such heinous acts, but he'd been given 
to understand, along with most of the 
station's population, that it was never 
actually going to have to use such 
destructive power. What had the man 
in charge?Tarkin, he remembered?
said on one of the public comcasts? 
"Fear would keep the systems in line." 
Ratua could understand that?it made 
a skewed kind of sense. But to 
actually use the station's ability; to 
annihilate an inhabited world, even 
one populated by the hardest hard 
cases in the galaxy, not even as a 
demonstration, but purely to test. . .
 That was something no sane man 
could grasp.
 The war had just taken a very ugly 
turn, and Ratua feared it might get 
worse before it got better.
 Commander Atour Riten, who was 
not given to much in the way of 
socializing, sat alone at a table, 
drinking a potent liquor distilled from 
some kind of tropical tuber on Ithor. It 
had quite a kick, and while he usually 
enjoyed the fiery taste, that wasn't the 
reason he was drinking it now.
 How had it come to pass that the 
Empire was destroying entire worlds? 
Atour was an intelligent and sensible 
man; he might be apolitical, but he 
wasn't naive. He was aware of the 
purpose for which this battle station 
had been built. The Death Star was a 
doomsday device, a weapon of such 
unimaginable horror that its very 
existence would, supposedly, prevent 
any insurrection, anywhere. Even the 
concept of war would become a thing 
of the past. And even if such ultimate 
power had to be demonstrated, there 
were plenty of uninhabited worlds 
floating out there; blow one of them 
to flinders and the message is 
delivered, loud and clear: Your world 
could be next.
 He had been naive, he realized. He'd 
let himself believe that there was a 
limit to inhumanity?that there could 
be such a thing as a weapon too 
powerful to use. But such was 
obviously not the case. There were, it 
appeared, no depths to which sentient 
beings could not sink. Build a blaster 
that could destroy a planet, and some 
bigger fool would build one that could 
extinguish a star. It would go on and 
on, insanity without end, because 
there's always a bigger blaster.
 How could a being with any 
conscience remain politically neutral 
after such an event?
 He took another swig from his glass. 
It was certainly enough to drive any 
sane being to drink.
 
 
 
 Teela and Vil sat at a table, drinks 
before them, but neither bothered to 
pick up their glasses. They didn't 
speak.
 She watched Vil stare moodily into 
his glass. He was a pilot, he was 
trained for war, he risked his life in 
fights?but even so, the destruction of 
Despayre had shaken him. Badly.
 Teela was beyond shaken. She was 
appalled. Horrified. She could have 
been on that world?she had been on 
that world, and if not for an ability the 
Empire had decided it needed, she 
would have still been down there 
when Despayre was shattered.
 She'd had nothing to do with the 
weapons aspect of building the 
station. She designed and built 
housing and recreation and living 
space. And she'd had no real choice, 
had she? After all, she was still a 
prisoner.
 Right?
 Her inner self could have a fine old 
time saying I told you so along about 
now, she knew. Instead, it was 
uncharacteristically silent.


58




THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DECK 69, 
DEATH STAR
 Uli sat at the bar next to a humanoid 
with unbelievably bright green eyes, 
and thought about cantinas he had 
frequented during his time in the 
military. Some had been fun, some 
merely places to get lit; some had 
been dens of comrades-in-thrall?
doctors, nurses, techs, all dragooned 
and forced to serve in a war that they 
all detested. The beings who had to 
patch up the wounded or cover the 
dead they couldn't save were 
generally less enthusiastic over the 
glory of war than most. After a 
thousand young people pass under 
your knife, torn and battered by the 
effects of blasters or shrapnel, it got 
old, and it made you weary to your 
depths. War was as stupid and 
antisurvivalist an action as a species 
could undertake, and if Uli could 
suddenly be made some kind of god, 
as his first act he would erase the 
knowledge and memory and ability to 
make war from the universe.
 Now the Empire had a planet 
buster?and here he was, on the 
blasted thing. How much worse could 
things get?
 "Hey, Doc."
 Uli looked to his left and saw a 
sergeant arrive at the bar. It took a 
couple of seconds to place the man?
he was a patient. The guy with the bad 
dreams and the midi-chlorians.
 "Sergeant Stihl. How are you 
sleeping?"
 "Truth is, hardly at all. Recently got 
worse. A lot worse." He sat on the 
stool.
 "I understand. Pills didn't help?"
 "Not really."
 "Sorry."
 "Me, too. I?" He stopped and 
looked past Uli at the green-eyed 
fellow on Uli's right. "Celot Ratua 
Dil?"
 Has to be a Zelosian, with those 
eyes, Uli thought. One of the rare 
chlorophyllians in the galaxy. And he 
and the sarge obviously knew each 
other.
 The plant man turned and stared, and 
Uli saw panic well briefly in those 
eyes. But then they resumed their 
slightly cynical outlook. "Well, blast," 
he said. "You changed your shift, 
didn't you, Stihl? I should've 
checked." He shook his head, 
shrugged, and grinned. "Oh, well."
 "What are you doing here?" the 
sergeant asked. No sound of hostility 
that Uli could tell; nevertheless, he 
was starting to feel acutely 
uncomfortable sitting between them.
 "Having a drink," Celot Ratua Dil 
said. "Wishing I were back on my 
homeworld. Things weren't so bad 
there, in retrospect. I could have had a 
pretty good life at home, but, no, I 
wanted to travel and see the galaxy. 
Stupid choice."
 The tender drifted over, and Uli 
noticed that her right hand was under 
the bar, out of sight. He was feeling 
very uncomfortable now.
 The tender, a Twi'lek, looked 
familiar, too. Where had he seen her? 
Ah, yes . . . just picture her naked. 
Another patient.
 "Dr. Divini, nice to see you again." 
She looked at the fellow to Uli's right. 
"Everything okay here?"
 The green-eyed man said, "Oh, yeah. 
Just renewing an old acquaintance. 
Been awhile."
 Stihl looked at the tender. "Memah. 
You know this guy?"
 She nodded. "I do."
 Stihl looked at the Zelosian again. 
Uli felt a current of something uneasy 
passing back and forth, and he leaned 
back a bit to get out of the flow.
 Stihl said, "How did?"
 "I decided to leave," Celot Ratua Dil 
said.
 Stihl didn't say anything for a 
moment. Then he looked at the
 Twi'lek woman behind the bar. "You 
wouldn't have your hand on a stunner 
under there, would you, Memah?"
 "I might."
 Stihl nodded, as if to himself. He 
looked at the Zelosian, then back at 
the Twi'lek. His eyebrows arched. "So 
that's how it is?"
 "That's how it is. And I do know 
who he is and where he came from."
 There was a pregnant silence.
 Uli said, "Pardon me for butting into 
what's probably not my business, but 
since I'm sitting in the middle of this 
conversation and we're all of a sudden 
talking about stunners, somebody 
want to tell me what's going on?"
 The other three looked at one 
another.
 The Zelosian said, "Sorry, Doctor, 
ah . . . Divini, is it? It's fairly 
straightforward. Before he was 
transferred here, Sergeant Stihl was a 
guard on Despayre?you know, that 
planet this station just blew to space 
dust? And I was, for a time, a resident 
there."
 "He's an escaped prisoner," Stihl 
said. His voice was still quiet and 
calm, but it carried clearly to them. 
He looked at his hands, which were, 
Uli noticed, quite callused. He looked 
back at the Zelosian. "You were 
sentenced there for life."
 "You mean 'death,' don't you, Sarge? 
Because when the powers-that-be on 
this station let go with that death ray, 
anybody who was on Despayre got 
cooked to ashes, and those ashes got 
blown all over the galaxy, if I recall 
recent history."
 Stihl nodded. "Yeah."
 "So now what?" the Twi'lek asked.
 "Yeah," Celot Ratua Dil added. 
"You can't exactly send me back, can 
you, Sarge?"
 Uli watched Stihl's face. He would 
probably be a good card player, 
because he wasn't giving anything 
away. "No," he finally said. "I guess I 
can't." He looked at Memah. "You 
really think he's worth pulling that 
stunner for?"
 "I really do."
 Another five seconds passed. Then: 
"How about a mug of Alarevi ale?" 
Stihl said. "And give the doc and 
Radish Boy here another of whatever 
they're drinking, on me."
 Memah nodded and removed her 
hand from under the bar. She and her 
boyfriend seemed a bit relieved. Not 
that much, but then Uli would wager 
his eventual possible IMSLO 
discharge that nobody was spiking 
any sine waves tonight. Shock tended 
to have that effect on people.
 He was aware that a potentially 
nasty situation had just been avoided, 
and it might be wise to let it lie, but he 
was curious. He said, "As I recall, 
Sergeant, aren't you some kind of 
martial artist?"
 "I am."
 "If the lady had pulled a stunner, 
couldn't you have defended yourself 
against it?"
 "Probably. But she wasn't the 
problem."
 "Oh?"
 "Want to show him?" he said, 
looking over Uli's shoulder at the 
Zelosian.
 "Sure. Where's your glass, Doc?"
 Uli turned away from the sergeant 
and looked at the bar. His half-drunk 
glass of beer was . . .
 Where was it?
 He looked up at the Zelosian. There 
was a blur of motion?
 His glass was back in front of him. 
The beer sloshed a bit but otherwise 
gave no indication that it hadn't been 
in front of him the whole time.
 Stihl laughed softly. "Ratua's fast."
 "I get that," Uli said. "So?if Memah 
had pulled her stunner, while you 
were dealing with her, Ratua could've 
clonked you one. If you'd gone after 
him first, she'd have stunned you."
 "Not a high-percentage situation for 
me," Stihl said.
 Uli blinked at him. "So just like that, 
you're okay with this? You're going to 
let it go?"
 Stihl nodded as Memah drew a mug 
full of dark ale for him. "Why not? 
Not like he's going anywhere, and he's 
right?I can't send him back to a place 
that doesn't exist anymore." He took 
the ale, smiled, and sipped at it. "Ah. 
Thanks." He looked back at Uli again. 
"And compared with what the Empire 
just did, how much harm could a 
smuggler do? You want to turn him 
in?"
 "Not particularly."
 "Well, there you are, then."
 The other drinks arrived, and the 
tender had poured one for herself.
 Uli held up his glass. "To the end of 
the war," he said.
 The others raised their glasses and 
echoed his words.

COMMAND CENTER, OVERBRIDGE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Tarkin looked at Vader, the 
unspoken question in his eyes. 
General Tagge stood there as well, 
still recovering, no doubt, from 
Tarkin's earlier revelations.
 Vader said, "Her resistance to the 
mind-probe is considerable. It will be 
some time before we can extract any 
information from her."
 Tarkin shook his head. Why was it 
always the small details that seemed 
to trip up the largest projects?
 One of his staff officers arrived. 
Tarkin regarded him.
 The man said, "The final checkout is 
completed. All systems are 
operational. What course shall we 
take?"
 Excellent! If the superlaser was now 
fully functional, they could go 
anywhere. But they needed the 
location of that base, and?ah, wait. 
Tarkin rubbed at his chin. "Perhaps 
she would respond to an alternative 
form of persuasion."
 "What do you mean?" Vader said.
 "I think it's time we demonstrated 
the full power of this station." He 
looked back at his officer. "Set your 
course for Alderaan."
 The man mumbled something and 
left, but Tarkin was already thinking 
ahead. If Princess Leia Organa was a 
thorn in the Empire's side, then 
Alderaan was a forest of thorns.
 Well, it was time to purge that forest. 
With fire.
 Tagge started to say something but 
apparently thought better of it. Tarkin 
smiled almost benignly and said, "I 
understand your concerns, General. 
Rest assured I've spoken with 
Emperor Palpatine recently about 
demonstrating his battle station's 
range and strength. He has assured me 
that I have full rein to do so." He 
looked at Vader. "You disapprove, 
Lord Vader?"
 "Not at all, Governor."



CELL 2187, DETENTION LEVEL, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Uli looked at the reads on his 
sensors. Princess Organa was doing as 
well as could be expected, given her 
unpleasant experience. If you didn't 
know what she had undergone, it 
would be hard to tell by looking at 
her.
 They were alone in the room?he 
had made the tech wait outside.
 "Thank you, Doctor . . . ? Sorry, I 
didn't get your name."
 "Divini. Kornell Divini. My friends 
call me Uli."
 "I appreciate your medical help, Dr. 
Divini, but I don't think we're going to 
be friends. I don't expect I'll be around 
much longer, and you are an Imperial 
officer, after all."
 He shrugged. "Not by choice. I was 
drafted. And they aren't letting 
doctors muster out, as I am sure 
you're aware."
 "You could have deserted."
 He laughed. "Really? When? I 
haven't been anywhere I could have
