calmer.
 But not calm enough. Nova laid back 
down, staring at the ceiling. So much 
for the sleeping meds helping things.



COMMAND CENTER, OVERBRIDGE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Tarkin looked at the data running up 
the screen, pleased. The station was 
nearly operational?at least enough so 
that they could begin basic 
maneuvers. The superlaser was only 
partially functional, true, but it was 
hot enough to test, and he had some 
ideas about how to do that.
 All in all, things were going very 
well indeed.
 There had been a few glitches. Daala 
had not been able to find those 
responsible for the destruction of the 
Undauntable. She had returned to the 
Maw, but would be back again, soon. 
Tarkin looked forward to her next 
visit.
 An intelligence report had just come 
to his attention. There had been some 
kind of break-in and theft at an out-of-
the-way military base on Danuta. 
While normally this would have been 
of little interest to Tarkin, the 
investigating agents had heard some 
intel?no more than rumor, really?
that one of the files stolen was a set of 
plans for this battle station. Tarkin 
frowned. On the face of it, that 
seemed unlikely? how would the 
plans have gotten to that backrocket 
planet in the first place?
 Then again, military secrets were 
notoriously hard to keep, and a file 
could be transmitted across the entire 
galaxy, given enough power in the 
generating signal. Some low-level 
functionary might have, at some 
point, come across the plans and 
decided to copy a set. There could be 
many reasons for doing so?
knowledge was power. How much 
would the plans be worth to the Rebel 
Alliance? A fortune, certainly; well 
worth the small risk of being found 
out.
 And if there was even a remote 
chance that such a thing had come to 
pass, if those plans had fallen into the 
clutches of the Rebels, that could be 
bad. The station, when fully 
operational, would be invulnerable 
from without, of course, but a 
saboteur who knew exactly where to 
do the most damage from within 
could be a real threat.
 This needed to be addressed, and 
Tarkin knew who was best suited for 
the task. It was galling to have to ask 
the man for help, but the station's 
safety was paramount.
 He moved to the holoplate and 
activated it. It was a priority-one 
communication, and the connection 
was made almost immediately.
 The shimmering image of Darth 
Vader appeared before Tarkin, life-
sized, as if he were standing in the 
same room.
 "Grand Moff Tarkin. Why have you 
called?"
 "I understand there is a remote 
possibility that a set of plans for this 
battle station may have been stolen by 
Alliance agents."
 "Yes."
 Tarkin clamped his teeth tight 
enough to make his jaw muscles ache. 
"You knew this?"
 "I have my own agents."
 The black helmet had no way to 
change expression, of course, but 
Tarkin could hear the amusement in 
the Dark Lord's voice. "I see," he said, 
his tone carefully neutral. Now was 
not the time to be at odds with the 
Emperor's lackey.
 "I will find out if it is true, and if so, 
I will deal with it." The black helmet 
inclined questioningly. "That is why 
you called me, isn't it?"
 Tarkin nodded. Vader might be 
many things, but fainthearted he was 
not. Once he began a task, he seldom 
swerved from finishing it. Odds were 
that the story was no more than a 
baseless rumor, but if not, no one was 
better equipped to determine the facts 
and eliminate the problem than Darth 
Vader. A useful, if dangerous, tool?
no matter how Tarkin might feel 
about him personally.
 "Keep me advised," he said.
 "Of course." The image of Vader 
vanished.
 
 
 
ISD DEVASTATOR, NEARTOPRAWA, 
KALAMITH SECTOR, NORTH 
QUADRANT
 
 Vader broke the comm connection 
with Tarkin. How had the man found 
out about the stolen plans so quickly? 
There must be a leak somewhere. 
There were always leaks. The only 
way to prevent them was to keep 
everything to yourself, and that was 
not always possible.
 Vader, of course, knew much more 
about the situation than he had told 
Tarkin. It was true: a set of plans had 
been stolen from a military base, and 
those plans were, indeed, now in 
Rebel hands. They had been 
smuggled to Darkknell, and then to 
Toprawa. There a band of Rebels had 
seized an Imperial communications 
tower and transmitted the plans to a 
blockade-runner orbiting the planet.
 The blockade-runner, he had 
learned, was the Tantive IV.
 Princess Leia Organa's vessel.
 Bail Organa and his daughter had 
been among those in the reconstituted 
Imperial Senate who had cast their lot 
with the Rebels. The proof was not 
there yet, but Vader knew. He did not 
even need the Force to assure him of 
this. He knew it.
 Doubtless her ship was on its way to 
deliver those plans to some secret 
Rebel base. Vader had to find and 
capture the craft before it arrived at its 
destination. Even though he would 
have preferred to follow the vessel to 
its destination and destroy the base, 
the destruction of another nest of 
Rebels was not as important as 
safeguarding his Master's prized battle 
station.
 Thus the Devastator was bound for 
Tatooine, where his agents had 
predicted the Tantive IV was headed. 
A secret base there made little sense, 
as the planet was mostly desert and of 
little military or commercial value. 
The world was far enough out of the 
main lanes so that the Rebels might 
have had a base there once, but that 
possibility had already been checked 
thoroughly by Imperial operatives, 
who had reported that no such place 
now existed.
 It made little sense. The planet was 
all sand and dunes, sparsely populated 
by colonists, both humans and other 
species, and the indigenous Tuskens. 
Vader knew just how inhospitable the 
place was. After all, he had spent his 
early years there?
 No. Anakin Skywalker had been 
raised in the hot, dry wasteland, but 
who he was now had been forged on a 
world that made Tatooine look like 
Hoth. He had been annealed in the 
molten rivers of Mustafar. Mustafar 
was his birthworld, not Tatooine.
 In any event, why the Princess was 
going there was unimportant. Perhaps 
she was just taking a roundabout route 
to throw off possible pursuit. What 
was important was that she had the 
plans for the Death Star, and that in 
itself was sufficient reason to detain 
her. The Empire would recover the 
plans and in so doing rid itself of her 
meddlesome actions at the same time.
 His Master would be pleased with 
both events.

SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, THETA 
SECTOR, DEATH STAR
 
 They hadn't lied. The differences 
between the simulator and the real 
thing were negligible. There were 
more worn spots and scratches in the 
simulator, put there over months of 
drills, but the equipment was 
identical.
 Despite all the training, Tenn was 
still a little nervous. This was the real 
thing; from here, they could generate 
a pulse of pure destruction that was 
stronger than anything ever fired 
before. Amazing, and not a little 
intimidating. Not that he expected to 
ever fire the weapon at full power, 
certainly not to destroy an entire 
planet. The whole idea, as he 
understood it, was that the threat 
would be more than enough. They'd 
probably disintegrate an uninhabited 
moon or two, just to prove they meant 
business, but the actual targets would 
be military?Rebel bases, fleets, and 
the like. For such as those, the 
superlaser would be a ridiculous 
amount of overkill, akin to frying a 
green flea with a turbolaser.
 "You've been hands-on in the 
simulator, you've seen the reads, so 
I'm not breaking any big news here," 
his CO said, breaking Tenn's reverie. 
"This is a monster gun, but it's not a 
repeater. You miss the first shot, you 
won't get another one on your shift."
 Tenn nodded. He'd asked about 
power storage first day on the 
simulator, and the engineers had 
fallen all over themselves backing 
away from that one. But once he'd 
seen the numbers?they had to keep 
those honest, even in sims?he'd 
figured it out pretty quick. The 
capacitors could hold enough juice to 
light up a planet, true enough, but 
once they discharged, they weren't 
going to be filling back up real quick. 
Once you shot the thing, you might as 
well turn off the lights and go take a 
long nap, because it wasn't going to 
be back up to full power for the better 
part of a day. True, you could still 
pump out some pretty nasty low-
power beams?and the definition of 
low here was still bigger than what a 
Star Destroyer could manage, even 
letting all the hardware spit at once?
but it would be a duster instead of a 
buster. You could scorch a city or 
two, boil away a large lake or perhaps 
even a small sea, but that was about it.
 And if you were the guy pulling the 
trigger and you missed, well, you'd be 
looking for a new job starting ten 
seconds after you said, Oops . . . 
 Tenn said, "My crew doesn't miss, 
Cap. You find a target and if we can 
see it, we will hit it, my personal 
guarantee."
 The CO laughed. "You shooters are 
all alike."
 "Check the records, Cap, check the 
records. They don't pay me to miss."
 The CO's face went serious. "I know 
that, Chief. But we don't get to pick 
the targets. It might get ugly."
 Tenn shrugged. "I'm not a politician 
or a Moff, sir. I do my job, let them 
do theirs."
 The CO slapped him on the 
shoulder. "Good man!" He sounded 
relieved.
 "So, we going to get operational 
here?"
 "Pretty quick, son. Let your crew get 
familiar with the knobs. It's all 
supposed to be the same, but we won't 
be shooting blanks. I don't want 
anybody to get the jeeblies when it 
comes time to crank it up for real."
 "I hear that, Cap. My crew won't let 
you down."
 "I know they won't, Chief. That's 
why they get the first shot. You retire 
and have the great-grandkids at your 
feet, you can tell them that? how you 
shot the first round from the biggest 
cannon ever made."
 "Something to look forward to," 
Tenn said. "That is, soon as I get a 
wife and get started on the kids who'll 
get that great-grandkid ball rolling."
 Both men laughed.




THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DECK 69, 
DEATH STAR
 
 I still find that a pretty bizarre 
coincidence," Memah said. "That out 
of all the cantinas in all the galaxy, 
the one guard who would know you 
on sight happens to walk into mine."
 "Stranger things have happened," 
Ratua said. "I knew a farmer on a 
legume co-op on Duro, one of fifty 
workers there. He was drafted into the 
navy. So he went through a year of 
basic training, shipped out, wound up 
being sent halfway across the galaxy 
to patrol in the middle of nowhere. He 
got liberty on a planet called Pzob. He 
walked into a Gamorrean pub, sat 
down, ordered an ale. Guy came out 
of the 'fresher and sat on the stool 
next to him, turned out to be a 
shiftmate back on the farm. Nine 
zillion klicks away from home, they 
both just happened to be in the same 
pub at the same time?what are the 
odds on that?"
 She shrugged. "Got me. Math was 
never my strength."
 "You don't seem to have much of a 
problem counting your credits."
 She smiled. Okay, so he was a bad 
boy, but he did make her laugh. That 
was worth a lot, these days.
 "Speaking of the worthy sergeant," 
he said, looking at his chrono, "I'd 
better take off. Stihl's duty shift is 
over in a few minutes and if he drops 
'round to have a brew with Rodo, I 
want to be elsewhere."
 "Good idea."
 "Dinner, when you get off? My 
place?"
 "As long as you promise not to 
cook."
 "You wound me, woman."
 "Better than poisoning you, like you 
nearly did me."
 "How was I to know your kind can't 
eat sweetweed?"
 "You could have looked it up. You 
plan to date outside your species, it's 
on you to know what's poison and 
what's not."
 "You're never going to let me forget 
it, are you?"
 "Not a chance, Green-Eyes. I'll pick 
up something on the way. Seafood, 
shellfish, like that."
 They smiled at each other. He put 
out his hand, she took it in her own, 
and they exchanged gentle squeezes. 
She could have done worse, Memah 
knew. She had done worse, more than 
once.
 After he was gone, she sighed and 
stretched, feeling tense muscles 
loosen. There were only a handful of 
customers in the place?it was just 
before shift change, and people were 
either on their way to work or about 
to get off, so it would be another hour 
or so before the Cantina started to fill 
up. Time to take a break. Business 
had generally been very good, better 
than she'd expected. As the station 
grew, new sections being added and 
pressurized, there had been new 
cantinas added regularly as well. 
There were at least half a dozen of 
them in this sector alone, and scores 
of watering holes throughout the other 
completed portions, but she hadn't 
noticed that the competition had hurt 
her any. True, she was getting only a 
small percentage of the profits, but 
even so, at the current rate, when her 
hitch was up she'd have enough saved 
to start a new place of her own.
 She wasn't sure she wanted to do 
that, however. Chances were good 
they'd offer her an extension on her 
contract, and she needed to think 
seriously about that when it happened. 
True, it was the military, so there 
were some rules a little stiffer than on 
a civilian planet, but even so it was 
clean, the patrons were generally well 
behaved, and she was making money 
like a jewel thief on a luxury 
spaceliner. She didn't miss the great 
outdoors?she'd never been much of a 
nature girl dirtside, and she'd only 
ventured out of the Southern 
Underground a few times. Not that 
there was much "outside" there, all of 
Imperial Center being essentially one 
large urban area, save for a few parks 
here and there.
 A cantina on an impregnable battle 
station, or one next to the space-docks 
in the slums of Imperial Center? Put 
that way, it didn't seem too hard a 
choice. Certainly this one was a lot 
safer than any she'd ever run before. 
Nobody was going to set it on fire by 
"accident," and from what she'd heard 
no Rebel ship could scratch the paint, 
much less really damage it.
 Staying on was definitely something 
to consider. She was having a pretty 
good time, all things considered, and 
Green-Eyes being around didn't hurt 
much, either.
 Memah smiled and hummed a tune 
as she began to mix more drinks.

TWO HUNDRED KILOMETERS OFF 
SECTOR N-FOUR, EQUATOR, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Vil slewed into a drifting turn to 
port, engine and pressors working 
hard to compensate for the "slide," 
and his pursuer, one of the newbies in 
Beta Two, wasn't quick enough to 
stay on his tail.
 He jinked again, this time to 
starboard, and again the newbie was a 
hair slow to react. Understandable; 
this wasn't a move they taught in basic 
flight school, it was one you learned 
from somebody with a lot more 
cockpit time than the instructors had 
to waste on trainees.
 The newbie said something excited 
that Vil didn't quite catch, but prayer 
or curse, it didn't help him: Vil had 
reversed their positions, finishing the 
loop lined up on the newbie's rear.
 Gotcha, kid. . .
 Vil thumbed the firing control and 
painted the newbie's backside with the 
scoring lasers. If his guns had been at 
full power, the kid would be dodging 
debris now, and both of them knew it.
 "No big, kid," he said over the 
comm. "We all got to slide down the 
learning curve?"
 "Attention, all squadrons, attention! 
Break off your drill immediately, I 
say again, break off all maneuvers 
immediately! Arm your laser cannons 
to combat mode, defensive pattern 
Prime, and stand by!"
 What the kark?
 The order was completely out of the 
black, but Vil was too well trained to 
question it. He swerved away and 
toggled his op-chan to his squad's 
frequency.
 "Alpha One, on me, pyramid 
formation, green and blue, one, one, 
two!"
 He punched the control button, and 
the signal diodes on his fighter began 
flashing in the sequence he'd given 
them, so that his squad would know 
his fighter and get to their positions. 
Green, one count. Green, one count. 
Blue, two counts, then repeated. Dit-
dit-dah . . . dit-dit-dah . . .
 "What's up, Loot?" That was Anyell, 
of course.
 "How should I know? Stow the 
chatter and listen!"
 The other pilots quickly assembled 
and moved into the pattern. It was the 
most basic of fighter maneuvers, 
practiced hundreds of times, and it 
didn't take more than a few seconds 
for all twelve to line up properly.
 Vil switched to the main operations 
report-in channel: "Alpha One is 
ready."
 Other squads logged on. There were 
10 of them out there, 120 fighters in 
all.
 After a moment, Command Channel 
took over:
 "All units, this is Grand Moff 
Tarkin. We have detected an enemy 
carrier shifting into realspace from 
lightspeed in Sector Seven, at two 
thousand, two hundred kilometers' 
distance from the station, repeat, 
enemy carrier in Sector Seven. The 
vessel is identified as the Fortressa, a 
Lucrehulk-class carrier. Star 
Destroyers are moving to engage, but 
we expect the enemy to launch 
fighters. They pose a risk to the 
station. Stop them."
 The local op-chan sig flashed, then 
overrode the main:
 "All fighters, all squadrons, this is 
Flight Commander Drolan, Dee Ess 
One One. We are deploying in Zone 
Defense Delta, I say again, Zee-Dee-
Delta. We are about to get our feet 
wet, boys, and I'm buying for the pilot 
who shoots the most of the fatherless 
scum out of the vac."
 Vil's mind was awhirl. Lucrehulk-
class vessels were originally Trade 
Federation ships, mostly modified 
commercial freighters. They were 
huge, circular craft, the biggest three 
thousand meters in length. After the 
Clone Wars, some of them had fallen 
under Rebel control. Unless the 
Alliance had done some major 
refitting, they weren't heavily armed, 
nor were they well shielded compared 
with a Star Destroyer, but they could 
carry a lot of fighters. Originally 
they'd spaced vulture droids, but the 
Rebels would have no doubt switched 
to X-wings. There might be a 
thousand of them in that ship, maybe 
more.
 Vil swallowed, his throat suddenly 
dry. This was it?the real thing, a full-
scale engagement, and his squad was 
going to be among the first ones to 
arrive at the party.
 It was both exciting and terrifying. 
This was what all the training had 
been for: not some police action on a 
backrocket planet but an actual battle 
with Rebel pilots, some of whom 
were vets who had flown TIE ships 
before they defected. This wouldn't be 
like shooting targets on a range or 
painting newbies with low-powered 
beams; this was do or die.
 This was why Vil Dance had signed 
on.
 Now it was time to see who had the 
right stuff and who didn't.



COMMAND CENTER, OVERBRIDGE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 "Our first wave of TIE fighters will 
arrive on zone station momentarily, 
sir. We have scrambled an additional 
thousand craft from the station." 
Admiral Motti didn't seem disturbed, 
but then he didn't have the primary 
responsibility. Tarkin did, and he was 
most aware of that as he looked at the 
hologram shimmering over the 
operations theater projection. He 
wasn't really surprised, however. He 
had halfway expected something like 
this for weeks, ever since they had 
lost the Undauntable to sabotage. The 
Rebels?some faction of them, at 
least?knew they were here, else they 
would not have been able to blow the 
ship up. Strategically, it made sense to 
attack the station now, before it was 
fully finished and operational. 
Tactically, a carrier was the smartest 
way. It would cost much, if not most, 
of the entire Rebel fleet to get past the 
Star Destroyers posted here in order 
to engage the battle station directly. 
But out of a thousand fighters or 
more, some might get by the TIE 
squads and inflict damage, even if the 
mother ship was taken out. Maybe not 
enough to destroy it, but if they could 
slow construction, that would be a 
victory of sorts.
 The lieutenant running the sensor 
array said, "Sir, the first wave of 
enemy fighters has left the carrier. 
Two hundred and fifty X-wings."
 As Tarkin nodded, the comm tech 
said, "Sir, I have a coded message 
incoming on your personal channel."
 Tarkin blinked. Who could that be? 
"Put it on my personal screen."
 Their TIE fighters were holding at a 
thousand klicks out, and it would take 
a few minutes for the X-wings to get 
that close to the station. The Star 
Destroyers were en route. There was 
nothing more to be done at the 
moment. Tarkin activated the 
message.
 Daala's face appeared on his screen.
 He tried not to let his surprise show. 
"Admiral?"
 "Grand Moff Tarkin. We're en route 
to the station, and it seems there is 
some interesting activity out there."
 "Nothing we can't handle," he said. 
"Though you might want to circle 
around and avoid it."
 "By it, you mean that enemy carrier 
and all those X-wings pouring out of 
it?"
 "Yes. That area is about to become 
inhospitable."
 "You're sending in Star Destroyers?"
 "I was, but as of this moment, I have 
a better idea."
 "Ah."
 "Precisely."
 "Well, I'll move away from?blast!"
 "Daala?"
 "We have company. Disconnect."
 She broke the connection, and 
Tarkin frowned. Daala was an 
excellent commander, and her ship 
was fast and well armed; she could 
deal with a few X-wings. Still. . .
 "Sir, the enemy has disgorged a 
second wave. That makes five 
hundred fighters," the sensor 
technician said.
 "We'll put a stop to that." To Motti, 
he said, "Admiral, have the Star 
Destroyers stand down. Break off 
their intercept."
 "Sir?" Motti looked at him as if he 
had just turned into a purple-dyed 
Wookiee. Tarkin smiled. He moved 
his hand over his comm.
 "Superlaser Control," came the 
response.
 Motti's expression changed. Now he 
smiled, too.
 "Commander," Tarkin said to the 
comm. "I have a target for you."



SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, THETA 
SECTOR, DEATH STAR
 
 The CO said, "You heard the man, 
Chief. Can you do it?" "Sir, no 
problem."
 "Two thousand, two hundred and 
nine kilometers. Not an easy target."
 "If we have the power to reach that 
far, I will hit it, sir," Tenn replied.
 The CO checked a readout. "We 
have four percent in the discharge 
capacitors."
 "More than we need," Tenn said.
 The CO looked relieved. "Go, 
Chief."
 Tenn nodded, turned to the console, 
and opened the speakers.
 "We have an order to commence 
primary ignition," he said to the crew. 
"All right, boys, let's pull the hammer 
back and cock this sodder! Report!"
 The various sections reported each 
operation's status, quickly and 
enthusiastically:
 "Hypermatter reactor level one 
twenty-fifth of maximum."
 "Capacitors, four percent available."
 "Tributaries one through eight, green 
for feed."
 "Primary power amplifier, green."
 "Firing field amp is . . . green."
 "We are go on induction hyperphase 
generator feed."
 "Tributary beam shaft fields 
aligned."
 "Tributary beam shafts one through 
eight clear."
 "Targeting field generator, ready."
 "We have primary beam focusing 
magnet at ten-sixteenths gauss . . . 
now fourteen-sixteenths . . . now at 
full."
 Tenn scanned his board. All green. 
Twenty-eight seconds. Not their 
fastest time, but not bad. "We're good 
to go," he told the CO.
 The CO nodded and said to the 
comm, "Grand Moff, superlaser is 
primed."
 The Grand Moff's voice over the 
comm was calm but crisp: "Then 
fire."
 The CO nodded at Tenn.
 As he had hundreds of times in 
simulated practice, Tenn thumbed the 
safety button on the shifter above his 
head and pulled the lever down. He 
counted silently:
 Four. . . three . . . two . . . one?
 "We have successful primary 
ignition," the computer's voice said.
 Tenn waited. The target was two 
thousand klicks away, so the time 
would be only?
 "A hit!" the targeting tech said. 
There was a pause as he scanned his 
scopes.
 "Well?" Term asked tensely.
 "It?it's . . . gone, Chief. Nothing 
left."
 Tenn blinked at the report. He 
looked at the CO, who looked just as 
dumbfounded.
 They had vaporized a carrier three 
kilometers across?with four percent 
power on the beam. Just like that.
 A cheer went up from the men in the 
room. The CO thumped Tenn's back. 
Tenn grinned in response, but inside, 
he was still having trouble believing 
it.
 Four percent. The total destructive 
potential was nothing short of 
astronomical. The power of a star, at 
his command.


50




COMMAND CENTER, OVERBRIDGE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Well," Motti said, "it appears that 
the superlaser works." Tarkin smiled. 
"So it does. But there are still five 
hundred enemy fighters out there and 
they have no place to go, so they have 
nothing to lose."
 "And we already have them 
outnumbered more than two to one, 
with TIE pilots itching to shoot them 
down, and plenty more where they 
came from," Motti said. "It's a 
cleanup operation now, Governor. 
They can't run, and they can't hide."
 Tarkin nodded. "Give the order," he 
said. "Tell our fighters to hit them 
hard and fast, while they're still 
reeling from what they just saw."
 "Sir? Your private channel again."
 Tarkin nodded and took the call.
 The man who appeared before him 
seemed upset. After a moment, Tarkin 
recognized the man as Daala's ship 
runner.
 "Yes, Captain Kameda?"
 "We were attacked by a squadron of 
X-wing fighters, sir. We destroyed 
them, but we took damaging fire."
 "Why isn't Admiral Daala telling me 
this herself?"
 "Sir, we lost shielding on the bridge. 
There was an explosion. Admiral 
Daala was injured."
 Tarkin felt his belly clutch tightly. 
"How bad?"
 "Not life threatening, sir. The medics 
have stabilized her."
