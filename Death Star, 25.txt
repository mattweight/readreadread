of the musty air.
 He was content.



COMMAND CENTER CONTROL ROOM, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Tarkin stood watching the 
planet/moon graphic as the orbit 
around the world came closer to being 
complete.
 Vader had taken out his elite TIE 
squad and knocked off several of the 
Rebels, though that hadn't been 
necessary. They couldn't hurt this 
station. Nothing could.
 An operations lieutenant 
approached. Tarkin looked at him. 
The man was obviously worried. He 
said, "We've analyzed their attack, sir, 
and there is a danger."
 Danger? Impossible!
 "Should I have your ship standing 
by?"
 Tarkin stared at the man. "Evacuate? 
In our moment of triumph? I think 
you overestimate their chances." He 
turned back to watch the graphic.
 Cut and run just as they were about 
to wipe out the head base of the 
Rebellion? Preposterous!
 The voice from the speaker said, 
"Rebel base, three minutes and 
closing."
 What harm could those last few 
fighters possibly do in that time? In 
less than three minutes, they would be 
orphans, easy pickings, and the war 
would effectively be won.



SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, DEATH 
STAR

 Tenn Graneet watched the graphic 
on his screen. The target would be 
within range in another couple of 
minutes.
 His mouth was as dry as desert sand, 
his belly churning like a heavy sea. 
He couldn't do this. He couldn't 
murder yet another world. But he 
couldn't stop it, either. Were he to 
stand down, another gunner would be 
up here to replace him in mere 
minutes, and he would be in the brig 
with a military death mark against 
him. What was he going to do?



E-2T MEDSHUTTLE 5537, YAVIN 
SYSTEM, GORDIAN REACH

 The bay doors opened, and Vil 
punched it. The little ship rocketed 
out. Now all he had to do was stay in 
the groove . . .
 "E-Two-Tee Medical Shuttle Five-
Five-Three-Seven, this is Flight 
Control. Where are you going?"
 Vil said, "Flight Control, this is 
Lieutenant Fayknom. We have an 
emergency pickup."
 "I show no record of your flight 
plan."
 Stall, Vil! "Hey, that's not my 
problem. I just fly where I'm told. 
Check with Door Control, they vetted 
us."
 "We are attempting to do that now, 
Lieutenant. Turn it around and return 
to the dock until we get it cleared up."
 "Negative on that, Flight Control. 
This is a priority mission. We come 
back, it'll be too late to do our job."
 The Flight Control officer was 
between a rock and a hard place, Vil 
knew. He had his protocols, and they 
weren't being met. But somebody had 
opened the doors and let the shuttle 
leave, so maybe it was a computer 
error. It wouldn't be the first one.
 "This is TIE x-one," came a deep 
voice over the comm. "What is the 
nature of your mission, shuttle?"
 Vil felt his insides freeze. Any 
starfighter pilot who knew a tractor 
from a pressor knew that designation. 
It was Vader himself on the comm.
 Vil said, "An incoming Imperial ship 
has been damaged by Rebel fire. They 
have wounded."
 "I know of no such Imperial 
arrivals," Vader said. "Return to the 
station."
 "Copy, Lord Vader. We are 
returning to the station." He shut off 
the comm.
 Ratua said, "What? Are you crazy?"
 "Relax," Vil said. "We aren't going 
back. But if he thinks we are, that 
buys us a few more seconds to get 
clear. We're faster than he is, once we 
get moving. He won't be able to?uh-
oh."
 "What?" That from Teela.
 "He's coming at us."



TIE X1

 The instant he had seen that medical 
conveyance, Vader had felt something 
wrong, a clamor from the dark side. 
While he ordered the shuttle back to 
the station, all it took was a moment's 
probing with the Force for him to 
recognize a mind that was familiar.
 There were several aboard, none of 
them weak-minded, but one . . . a 
woman . . . where had he felt her 
before?
 Ah, he had it. On the station, when 
he had toured during construction. 
One of the builders, an architect, had 
shut him out of her thoughts, as if 
slamming a door in his face. He'd 
been impressed by her strength of 
mind and will.
 What was an architect doing on a 
medical rescue ship?
 And then he knew: deserters!
 His anger surged. There were so 
many things about this project that he 
had not been able to control. Well, he 
could deal with this! The X-wings 
could wait a moment or two longer. 
He would take care of these traitors 
himself. They would learn that 
resisting Darth Vader was fatal. . .
 As he and his wingmates bore in, the 
medical ship slewed into a tight, high-
g turn. Vader felt the fabric of the 
Force shiver as he adjusted his path to 
intercept.
 He opened the channel again. 
"Return to the station, shuttle, or I 
will fire on you," he said.



E-2T MED SHUTTLE 5537
 
 They were in deep trouble, Vil 
knew. They weren't even armed, and 
Darth Vader was the best fighter pilot 
in the galaxy. He remembered saying 
something once to, the effect that he 
would probably just augur his ship in 
if he ever found himself in Vader's 
crosshairs?that way at least he got to 
choose when to die.
 It wasn't just his life on the line now, 
though.
 Desperate, Vil ran every trick he 
could think of through his mind. None 
of them was going to do the job. They 
were cooked. Unless . . .



TIE X1
 
 Vader bored in. The targeting 
computer narrowed the scan. He had a 
lock. Whatever they were up to?
spies, perhaps??it didn't matter. He 
would eliminate them, then return to 
the main task. He thumbed the fire 
buttons.


72




E-2TMEDSHUTTLE5537
 
 Vil slapped the retrofire controls. 
The reverse thrusters all lit full-out. 
The ambulance didn't stop, but it 
slowed enough so that Vader and his 
two wingmates blew past as if the 
larger craft were standing still.
 Vil punched the sublights back up to 
full and angled to starboard. No tricks 
now, just a straight run, a sprint?



TIEX1
 
 Vader was angry with himself. 
They'd used such an obvious and 
simple avoidance ploy that he hadn't 
seen it coming, even through the 
Force. He toggled the comm channel. 
"Get a tractor beam on that 
medshuttle!"
 The reply crackled through his 
headphones. "I'm sorry, Lord Vader, 
but the beam generator for that sector 
has tripped its breakers. We'll have it 
back online momentarily?"
 Blast!
 Vader swung around to follow the 
fleeing ship.
 "Lord Vader," came the voice of one 
of his TIE pilots.
 "What is it?"
 "Another trio of X-wing fighters is 
making a run up the same trench."
 Vader reached out with the dark 
side, seeking . . .
 And immediately sensed a presence 
in whom the Force was powerful, as 
powerful as it would be in a Jedi 
Knight.
 Vader realized immediately that this 
was by far the greater problem.
 "Break off," he ordered his 
wingmates. "Back to the station to 
intercept the new attackers."
 "What about the medshuttle?"
 "Let it go. It's not important."
 Vader led his pilots back toward the 
station. They arrowed down into the 
trench, their fighters screaming 
between the high walls.
 There were the three X-wings. Vader 
and his wingmates followed, blasting 
them one by one. Again, no real effort 
was necessary. Were they all suicidal?
 But, he realized, none of them was 
carrying the pilot with whom the 
Force had been riding. That one was 
still out here somewhere. Vader knew 
he had to find that one. He was a 
danger?perhaps the only real danger.
 "I need locations on the remaining 
Rebel fighters," he said.
 "At once, Lord Vader." There was a 
short pause. "There are only three 
more, my lord, and they have just 
entered?"
 "?the same trench," Vader finished. 
Whatever the target, the Rebels were 
convinced it was worth every ship 
they had. He knew he had best finish 
the last three quickly.



E-2T MEDSHUTTLE 5537
 
 Vil didn't know why Vader had 
broken off the pursuit, but he wasn't 
complaining. He tried to coax a little 
more juice out of the sublight engines. 
The encounter with Vader had lost 
them precious time; they still had to 
make it out of tractor beam range 
before?
 He felt the ship lurch, even as Ratua 
asked, "Why are we slowing down?"
 Vil shoved the feeder slide control to 
maximum, but the shuttle continued 
to slow. He said, "They've got the 
tractor beam working again."
 "Can we break free?" Uli asked.
 "I don't know. We should be right at 
the limits of its range. I'm locking in 
the auxiliary power ..." He dialed up 
the rheostat, suiting action to words. 
The E-2T surged, then slowed again.
 "Vil?"Teelasaid.
 "We're still moving in the right 
direction," he said. "There's still a?"
 The ambulance ship started to 
shudder; then, after a few more 
seconds, it stopped.
 Then it began to move backward.
 "Frag," Vil said, his voice quiet. 
"They got us."
 The engines strained, but there was a 
definite increased speed stern-ward. 
The drive power dials started to move 
into the overload zones. "The 
engines'll blow if I don't shut them 
down," Vil said.
 "Let them," Teela said. "Better to die 
trying than to let them capture and 
execute us. We owe Atour, Nova, and 
Rodo that much."
 Vil looked around. The others all 
nodded. He reached for Teela's hand, 
held it.


73




COMMAND CENTER CONTROL ROOM, 
DEATH STAR
 
 The officer said, "Less than a 
minute, sir." Tarkin nodded. Seconds 
away from glory. At last. After the 
years of scheming, of work, now he 
would show them, show them all!



TIE X1 MERIDIAN TRENCH
 
 Vader and his two wingmates flew 
the trench, the last three X-wings dead 
ahead.
 His wingmate fired, hit one of the 
Rebels. The wounded ship pulled up, 
out of the fight.
 "Let him go," Vader commanded. 
"Stay on the leader!"
 One of the ships hung back, 
obviously trying to delay Vader and 
his pilots. He focused on it. Lined up.
 Fired.
 The ship exploded.
 One left. Vader moved to engage 
him. "I'm on the leader," he 
announced.
 The TIE X1 screamed down the 
length of the trench, hot on the X-
wing's tail. Closer . . . almost there ...
 Vader felt energy coming from the 
pilot in almost palpable waves. "The 
Force is strong in this one," he said, 
more to himself than his wing-mates.
 Strong, but not strong enough to stop 
Vader. Not strong enough to prevent 
the man who killed Obi-Wan Kenobi 
from doing what had to be done.
 Vader triggered his guns.
 He hit the fighter's R2 unit, saw the 
smoke and flames erupt from the hit.
 Good.
 Now, he thought, we finish this.



COMMAND CENTER CONTROL ROOM, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Rebel base is in range," the voice 
from the comm said. Elated, Tarkin 
turned to Motti. He kept his voice 
calm. "You may fire when ready."



TIE X1 MERIDIAN TRENCH
 
 Slowly, Vader crept up on the last 
X-wing. The Force swirled about the 
mysterious pilot; eddies, clouds, a 
vortex of powerful energy. Who could 
this be? This was no Jedi, of that 
Vader was certain, but he was steeped 
in the Force like one.
 The target danced back and forth 
across his screen. Then, finally, a 
lock!
 "I have you now," Vader murmured. 
He moved to thumb the firing buttons. 
Then, suddenly?
 His starboard wingmate's TIE 
exploded.
 "What?" Vader twisted about, trying 
to see through the cockpit's 
transparisteel while simultaneously 
reaching out with the Force. Enemy 
fire was coming in from a totally 
unexpected direction. But how? There 
weren't any more enemy fighters in 
the vicinity!
 Then he felt the attacker?
approaching from above, to the port 
side. Vader couldn't see it, but his 
remaining wingmate could. He 
screamed, "Look out?.'"
 The port wingmate's TIE collided 
with Vader's ship and was knocked 
spinning, out of control. The X1 
ricocheted off the wingmate, sending 
the latter to a fiery doom against a 
trench wall. Vader's ship was hurled 
out of the trench and sent, pitching 
and yawing, into an uncontrollable 
series of flips.
 At one point, he caught a blurred 
glimpse of the unexpected attacker. 
He couldn't be sure, but it looked like 
the battered old Corellian freighter 
he'd investigated earlier, which had 
escaped just after his duel with Obi-
Wan.
 No time to wonder about that now. 
Vader fought to stabilize his craft, but 
the control surfaces were damaged. 
He had to use his drive pulses.
 His TIE continued to spin, however, 
and he realized he was an easy target. 
He managed to get the spin under 
control and then ready the little ship 
for the jump to lightspeed. A second 
or two would be enough. A couple of 
light-seconds would put him more 
than half a million kilometers away 
and give him a chance to get the TIE 
under control.
 But, he realized grimly, whatever 
that pilot who was one with the Force 
planned to shoot, he was now going to 
have a chance to hit it.


74




SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Tenn heard the order as if he were at 
the bottom of a deep mine shaft. It 
echoed over him:
 "Commence primary ignition."
 His crew threw switches, adjusted 
rheostats, pushed buttons. The status 
reports came in one by one, like 
pronouncements of doom.
 All too soon, it was down to him. 
Slowly, Tenn lifted the incredible 
tonnage of his right arm. His hand 
trembled on the lever. He saw his CO 
watching him through the smoked 
lens of the blast helmet. He could read 
the man's mind: Shoot, Chief! Shoot!
 Tenn wasn't a believer in anything 
more than he could see and hear and 
touch, never had been. But now he 
prayed for a miracle?for something, 
anything, to deliver him from the 
burden of so many more deaths. For 
something to stop it, somehow. With 
his free hand he activated the comm. 
"Stand by," he said, hardly knowing 
why he was saying it, seeking only to 
delay the inevitable as long as 
possible.
 "Stand by . . ."
 
 
 
COMMAND CENTER CONTROL ROOM, 
DEATH STAR

 Motti yelled in the background: 
"They've fired proton torpedoes down 
an auxiliary heat shaft! Incoming! 
Incoming! The reactor will blow!"
 Tarkin blinked. No. No, it wouldn't. 
He was calm. All would be well. This 
station was invulnerable. It was 
unbeatable. It was unthinkable that it 
could be beaten. Unthinkable?



E-2T MED SHUTTLE 5537

 The shuttle suddenly leapt forward 
as if kicked by a giant's boot. The 
inertial dampeners kept them from 
being whiplashed, but they could see 
the starfield shift crazily about them.
 "What the?" Ratua began. He 
stopped as he, and the rest of them, 
stared.
 The rear viewer was focused on the 
Death Star, which had exploded in a 
silent, horrendous flare of red and 
orange and yellow. A hyperspa-tial 
reflux ring expanded outward.
 "What. . . ?" Memah was shaking 
her head in disbelief.
 "It blew up," Uli said. He sounded 
stunned. "The Death Star just. . . blew 
up."
 "Everybody, hang on," Vil said. 
"The edge of the shock wave will hit 
us pretty fast?"
 The ship jumped, shook suddenly, 
then began to tumble, a leaf in a gale.
 "Kark!" Vil said, fighting to regain 
control of the ambulance. "I hope she 
doesn't break up!"
 The tumble continued. There was a 
bad moment, another worse one?and 
then the battering stopped.
 "What happened?" Teela asked.
 "Shock wave passed us. We're still 
in one piece." Vil engaged the sub-
lights. "Now if we can just stay ahead 
of the shrapnel we should be okay."
 "Remind me to find out who made 
this ambulance," Ratua said. "I want 
to send them a testimonial. And if 
they make flitters, I want to buy one."
 The others laughed?the relieved 
laughter of those narrowly delivered 
from death. All except Teela.
 "Teela?" Vil said. "You okay?"
 "Yeah. It's just that?the Death Star 
was a monster, no question about that. 
It was conceived by monsters and 
controlled by them. But not everyone 
on board was a monster."
 Nobody said anything for a while.
 "How did it happen?" Ratua asked. 
"Was it the Alliance, or did someone 
just push the wrong button?"
 "We'll never know," Memah said.
 "The superlaser must've misfired. 
That's the only explanation that makes 
any sense," Vil replied. "It couldn't 
have been anything the Rebels threw 
at it. Those X-wings were like buzz-
beetles trying to take down a ronto."
 "Don't be too sure," Teela said. She 
quickly explained about the 
unshielded vent.
 Vil looked skeptical. "I'm not buying 
it. Even with the targeting computer, 
the chances of lobbing a proton 
torpedo down that shaft were a 
million to one."
 Teela smiled. "What was it you told 
me once? Sometimes long odds are 
the only ones worth playing?"
 There was another short silence.
 "So what now?" Uli asked. He was 
tired, and he could see that the others 
were, too. They were all in fairly 
heavy shock. Watching two planets?
or one planet and one battle station 
the size of a moon?blow up within 
the span of a cycle was just too much 
for the mind to encompass.
 "We have pretty good star charts," 
Vil said. "And a decent cruising 
range. We can get to any of half a 
dozen systems. But there's a Rebel 
base on that moon right over there, 
and I'd guess they're pretty happy 
right now. Might be room for a few 
people willing to sign up."
 "You'd do that?" Memah asked. 
"Join the Rebellion?"
 Vil shrugged. "I'm a fighter pilot. It's 
what I do, and I'm good at it. More to 
the point, I'm a fighter pilot who's 
extremely disillusioned with the side 
I've been on. In addition to my 
piloting skills, I can take a TIE apart 
blindfolded and put it back together. I 
know a few secrets our new friends 
might be interested in."
 "Not to mention," Memah said, 
"you're the man who outflew Darth 
Vader."
 Vil grinned, then looked at Teela. 
"Of course, it depends on your plans."
 "It does? Why might that be?"
 Vil looked like he'd just swallowed a 
cup of too-hot caf. "Well," he said, "if 
you're agreeable, I thought we might 
get married."
 "Interesting way to propose, flyboy," 
she said. "I'll think about it." But she 
grinned. Then her expression turned 
serious. "They'll need planners and 
designers, too," she said. "And I 
wouldn't be a prisoner, but a free 
woman. There are a lot of political 
prisoners still under the Empire's 
hand. I'd like to help them."
 Memah said, "Not a bad idea. Maybe 
I'll tag along, try to find another 
cantina to run. Girl's got to eat, after 
all, and I'm guessing the Rebels don't 
mind lifting a glass now and then."
 "I wouldn't worry about having to 
work if I were you," Ratua said to her.
 "No offense, Green-Eyes, but as 
much fun as you are, I don't want to 
be a smuggler's woman. I'm done with 
the adventurous life for a while."
 "Well, I was thinking of getting out 
of the smuggling business," he said. 
"Into legal ventures."
 "Uh-huh."
 Ratua grinned. "Probably should 
have mentioned that my family is, 
um, well fixed. I think they'd like to 
meet you. They always hoped I'd find 
a good woman and settle down, get 
into the family business."
 "Which is?"
 "They manage real estate. Own a 
few properties, here and there. Places 
like the Netaluma Tower on Imperial 
Center."
 "Coruscant," Uli corrected him. He 
realized it was a measure of just how 
tired he was that Ratua's admission of 
wealth was hardly even surprising.
 "My mistake. Anyway, my share of 
that alone would mean you wouldn't 
have to work if you didn't want to."
 "Your share? And how much would 
that be?"
 "Well... "He hesitated.
 "Speak, or I'll twist your head off."
 "Half a billion credits, give or take a 
couple of million."
 She stared at him. "What? You're 
rich? Why'd you become a 
smuggler?"
 Ratua shrugged. "I thought property 
management was boring. I was young 
and rebellious, and I wanted to do 
something more interesting. But I'm 
thinking maybe I've had enough 
excitement for one lifetime."
 "I'm going to kill you," Memah said. 
"No, maybe I'll wait until after I meet 
your family. They'll probably want to 
help."
 Teela looked at Uli. "What about 
you, Doc?"
 What, indeed? Uli opened his mouth, 
fully intending to tell them that he 
planned to head for the farthest stars, 
to find a world somewhere way out in 
the Reach and open up a practice 
there. Someplace where neither the 
Empire nor the Alliance was known. 
He'd been working in unwilling 
servitude for just about all of his adult 
life, after all. Freedom?the ability to 
choose where he wanted to work, for 
how long, and for whom, if anyone, 
was a powerful lure.
 But what he heard himself say was, 
"I'm with Vil. If the Rebellion will 
have me, I'll throw in my lot with 
theirs. I'm a pretty good battle 
surgeon?at least, I've had a lot of 
practice. And the Empire has to be 
stopped."
 "Somebody made a pretty good start 
on that today," Memah said.
 "So," Vil said, "since we're all in 
agreement, let's go see how the other 
half lives, shall we?"

TIE X1, INTERPLANETARY SPACE, 
YAVIN SYSTEM
 
 Darth Vader had been safely out of 
danger when the Death Star had 
blown up. His ship was damaged, but 
still spaceworthy enough that, with a 
couple of careful jumps, he could 
reach a hidden Imperial naval base a 
few light-years away.
 Despite the direness of the situation, 
he couldn't help another painful smile. 
The Death Star, with all its troops and 
weapons, the superlaser that could by 
itself destroy entire planets, trillions 
of credits' worth of labor and 
material?all of it was gone to 
incandescent dust in an instant.
 He didn't know exactly how it had 
happened, but he knew it had 
something to do with the pilot of that 
tiny, insignificant X-wing. Somehow, 
he alone had taken out the battle 
station. Vader didn't need the dark 
side to tell him that, or that the pilot 
had survived the explosion.
 One man had done what a fleet could 
not have managed.
 The Force was indeed strong in this 
one.
 Who was he? Not a Jedi?Vader 
was certain. He had felt no sense of 
the control that a Jedi would possess. 
In the final analysis, however, it really 
didn't matter. Be the mysterious 
stranger a Jedi or not, Vader knew 
that he and this other who was so 
permeated with the Force would meet 
again.
 It was inevitable.
 He checked his position and readied 
his small ship for the next insertion 
into hyperspace. He knew he would 
have to make his report to the 
Emperor immediately, even though he 
was certain that the Dark Lord of the 
Sith was already aware of what had 
happened to his pet project. He was 
not looking forward to the meeting. 
As he made the jump to light-speed 
and beyond, Darth Vader was certain 
of one thing:
 His Master would not be pleased.
