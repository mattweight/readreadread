 "You're kidding, right?"
 The CO shook his head regretfully. 
"How am I going to replace you?"
 Tenn blinked. "What, you aren't 
coming?"
 "Not me. My tour is over soon, and 
I'm mustering out. One of my in-laws 
runs a good-sized industrial 
operation?I have a job waiting."
 "Oh, that sounds exciting. Making 
widgets? Moving sewage? C'mon, 
Cap. You and me, pulling trigger on 
the biggest?"
 "Job pays three times as well and the 
only thing dangerous about it might 
be having the wife find out where I'm 
hiding the girlfriend."
 They both laughed. Then Hoberd 
continued, "No guns're operational 
yet. There are only a few sectors even 
pressurized, but you're the best 
shooter in the fleet and they're lucky 
to have you. They want you over 
there as soon as possible to begin 
orientation."
 Tenn felt like his head would split in 
half if his grin got any bigger. The CO 
was right: who better to pull the firing 
lever on the superlaser? This was the 
biggest, most powerful weapon ever 
built. Ever. This was as good as it got. 
He could bask in the warm glow of 
that for quite a while.
 "Well, what're you waiting for? Go 
on! Next time I see you your ugly 
mug had better be hidden behind one 
of those snazzy black visors they wear 
over there."
 CPO Tenn Graneet walked out of 
Captain Hoberd's office feeling as 
though something had gone wrong 
with the corridor's gravity, because he 
was definitely walking on air. Just 
wait until Droot and Velvalee heard 
the news. The best shot in the galaxy 
paired with the biggest gun . . .  Tenn 
slapped his hands together, rubbing 
them with enthusiasm. He couldn't 
wait to get his hands on those 
controls.

THE SOFT HEART CANTINA, SOUTHERN 
UNDERGROUND, GRID 19, IMPERIAL 
CITY
 
 Memah stood on the walk in front of 
what had been her cantina, stunned 
beyond words. The Soft Heart was no 
more than ashes and cinders, still 
warm, soot and smoke twirling up 
toward the exhaust fans in a dirty 
breeze.
 And it wasn't just her place. The 
whole block had burned. The fire-
suppression sprayers had 
unaccountably malfunctioned, 
according to the unofficial reports, at 
least, and the droid fire crews had 
been sent to the wrong location, so 
that by the time they arrived and 
began their efforts to control the 
blaze, it had been too late by far. They 
were lucky to have kept it from 
spreading to the whole sector, they 
said.
 Memah still couldn't get her mind 
around it. This wasn't just a building 
reduced to ashes. This was her life.
 Rodo came to stand next to her, his 
face grim. "Varlo Brim was 
discovered dead in his cube this 
morning."
 She frowned. "Who?"
 "An arsonist, a professional. I know 
someone who works for the medical 
examiner. 'Heart failure' was entered 
on Varlo's certificate? before his 
body ever arrived at the morgue. 
Word from above was that there was 
to be no detailed examination of the 
corpse."
 She turned away from what had been 
her reason to get up every day and 
blinked at him. The ash-laden air 
made her eyes watery. It seemed 
important that she understand what 
Rodo was trying to tell her, but, 
though he was speaking in Basic, the 
words didn't seem to make sense. 
"Which means . . .  what?"
 "Think about it. A block of the 
underground goes up in flames. The 
suppressors, which passed inspection 
less than two months ago, suddenly 
don't work. The fire crews get here 
late, and the next morning a man who 
sets fires for a living is found dead of 
'natural causes' in his cube. Plus all 
those deliveries that didn't get made? 
It doesn't take a construction engineer 
to put it together."
 Memah stared at him. "Kark," she 
said.
 "Yeah. Somebody is collecting a fat 
insurance voucher. What d'you want 
to bet that construction's gonna crank 
up on a new row of shiny new 
businesses that are gonna be owned 
by some uplevel bosses who just 
happen to be bureaucrats responsible 
for the firefighters and automatic 
suppressors?"
 "And we can't do anything about it," 
she said.
 "Not if the fix was in. You had it 
covered?" He nodded at the ashes. 
"Insured?"
 "No. I never saw the need, what with 
the suppressors and all."
 Rodo nodded. She was grateful for 
the lack of rebuke in his face and 
voice. "What are you gonna do?"
 Memah shook her head. "No idea."
 There were others wandering 
through the ruins, humans and aliens, 
looking at what had been their shops, 
the repositories of their hopes and 
dreams. And gawkers, fire-control 
droids still checking hot spots, local 
police . . .  the strangely silent crowd, 
moving in and out of the smoky mist 
like revenants, made it all seem quite 
surreal.
 A man in black coveralls approached 
them. His gaze took in the pile of 
smoldering cinders, and he shook his 
head. "Sorry for your loss, Memah 
Roothes."
 Again, she understood the words, 
but they meant nothing. "Do I know 
you?"
 "No. I'm Neet Alamant, a recruiter 
for Civilian Adjunct to the Imperial 
Navy."
 "Yeah?so?"
 "I have an offer you might find 
interesting."
 Memah gave a bark of bitter 
laughter. "Unless you're looking for 
plant fertilizer"?she gestured at the 
ruins?"I don't have a lot for sale 
right about now."
 "I understand. Perhaps we might 
speak of this later? Here is my contact 
information. Please comm me when 
you have a free moment."
 He handed her an info button, 
flashed a patently false smile, and 
walked across the street toward 
several people standing in front of 
what had been a bakery.
 Memah stared at the button on her 
palm. A free moment? Sure, no 
problem. She'd have plenty of those 
upcoming. She'd be sitting in her 
room on the dole with nothing to do, 
remembering the good old days when 
she ran a pub.
 She looked at Rodo. He shrugged.
 Memah looked back at the ruin of 
her cantina. What was she going to do 
now?



MEDCENTER, SECTOR N-ONE, DEATH 
STAR
 
 Uli passed his hands under the UV 
sterilizer, then wiped them on a clean 
towel. The orderly droid floated the 
patient out and toward post-op. They 
were caught up, no more patients 
scheduled for surgery or follow-ups 
until rounds that evening. A break at 
long last.
 "You should come see this, Doc," 
Zam Stenza, one of the orderlies, said.
 Curious, Uli followed the orderly 
through the staging area and down a 
half-finished passage that was more 
catwalk than corridor. His boots 
thumped upon the cheap expanded 
metal grate that was the temporary 
floor of the corridor, and the sound 
echoed hollowly along the hallway. 
This section was supposed to be 
finished, but it looked only half done; 
less, in places. There was enough air, 
but there were construction droids 
crawling like metal spiders on the 
inside of the hull, welding studs and 
connectors and adding insulation. Uli 
saw unsealed gaps in the interior 
walls. Sure hope they don't pop a 
seam somewhere, he thought 
nervously. He was fairly certain that 
carrying on shirtsleeve activity in 
such a precarious environment was 
contravening several safety regs, and 
he was equally sure that it would do 
no good whatsoever to point this out.
 Stenza stopped to look through the 
window at a lower walkway. Uli 
moved closer to see what was so 
interesting.
 A group of pedestrians was moving 
along the wide passage. It consisted of 
guards, high-ranked officers, and one 
man in black who towered over thern 
all.
 "Who's that?" Uli asked, feeling like 
he should know.
 "Darth Vader," Zam said. "He's here 
on an inspection tour."
 Uli stared at the tall, black-cloaked 
figure. He knew about Vader, of 
course. He'd seen vids of the man?if 
that was what he really still was under 
the suit, which looked like it 
contained some kind of cyclic 
respiratory system, and probably 
bionic prosthetics as well, judging by 
his gait. The stiffness was subtle, but 
there if you knew where to look.
 "Inspection tour?"
 "Yes," said C-4ME-0, who had come 
up behind them. "This project is of 
prime concern to the Emperor."
 "And just how do you know this, 
Fourmio? Tight with the Emperor, are 
you?"
 "No, but I was put into service on 
Coruscant before it became Imperial 
Center. I've never had a mindwipe, so 
I have my memories of that time. 
Droids do sometimes talk to one 
another, you know. Word gets 
around."
 Uli nodded. Yes, that was true 
enough. There was a lot of truth in the 
old saw that said, If you want to know 
what goes on, ask the droids. They 
see, they hear, and they don't forget. 
He had known some droids who were 
every bit as clever and talkative as 
any natural-borns or clones he'd been 
around. There'd been that protocol 
droid back at Rimsoo Seven on 
Drongar?what had it been called??
who'd been self-aware enough to play 
sabacc and gloat over the winnings. It 
had had a sarcastic circuit a klick 
wide.
 Uli watched the procession pass. 
"Walked right past us, didn't they?"
 "The word is that Lord Vader is not 
fond of medics," C-4ME-0 said. 
"Apparently he has had some 
unpleasant experiences in that area."
 Uli nodded. He could see why. The 
only reason he could imagine that 
someone would be stuffed into a lung-
suit with a respirator breathing for 
him would be because his own 
breathing passages had been terribly 
damaged and, for some reason, new 
lobes and trachea could not be cloned 
and implanted. That would be a 
strange malady in this day and age, 
but not impossible. Some kind of 
autoimmune problem, perhaps.
 There were those rare people, one in 
a billion, who would reject their own 
matched genetic tissue implants?
even skin grafts. Had to be something 
like that, Uli mused?nobody would 
voluntarily walk around looking like 
Vader otherwise.
 "Supposedly he can kill a man just 
by looking at him," Stenza said. He 
dropped his voice to a whisper. "I 
heard a rumor that he was once a 
Jedi."
 Uli nodded. The mysterious Force 
was fairly amazing when manifested 
by an expert in its use. Uli had seen it 
demonstrated by a woman who had 
been part of the team on Drongar. She 
had been a Mirialan, a Jedi healer 
named Barriss Offee. Only a Padawan 
when he'd met her; later she had 
become a Jedi Knight. He'd learned a 
lot from conversations with her, both 
about the ways of the Jedi and, in 
broader terms, about life. She'd been 
strong in the Force, he'd been told. 
Not that it had been enough to save 
her. Barriss had died on Felucia, so he 
had heard, when the clones had turned 
on their Jedi masters.
 The news had hit him far worse than 
he'd expected. He'd told himself many 
times, in the nearly two decades since 
his first posting on that fetid swamp 
world, that what he'd felt for Barriss 
had been nothing more than youthful 
infatuation. It might be true, but he 
could still see her face in his mind, 
hear her voice, feel the power that had 
lived inside her. Even after all these 
years.
 Maybe he hadn't loved her. Maybe 
he'd been too young to know what 
love was, back then. But when he had 
heard of her death . . . 
 So many people he had cared deeply 
for were dead because of that karking 
war. Probably some of the Jedi had 
escaped death, but the official posture 
was that they had all been enemies of 
the people and executed accordingly. 
And all research into the psionic 
abilities of the former peacekeepers of 
the galaxy had been summarily 
halted. To venture into that area was 
worth the death penalty these days. 
Lot of that going around, too. Step 
wrong and it was prison if you were 
lucky, and death if you trod too hard 
on the wrong toes. Given all this, it 
was amazing that Vader would 
tolerate even the rumor of him being a 
Jedi.
 He sighed. Well, it wasn't his 
business. He was a surgeon. Genetics, 
esoteric mind-over-matter control, 
connections with the infinite . . .  
those weren't his concerns. He just 
went where he was told, cut where he 
was ordered to cut, and hoped that his 
forced servitude would end someday, 
preferably with him still in one piece. 
Initially he'd thought that the only 
good thing about being assigned to a 
battle station the size and power of this 
one was not having to worry about 
being blown up That was before the 
first influx of wounded workers from 
the bombed section had come under 
his knife. Nothing was safe, not even 
this monstrous Death Star.
 Uli turned away. There should be 
time to grab a bite at the commissary, 
and a few hours' sleep, before his next 
shift. Unless there was more sabotage, 
of course.
 He wished he could remember the 
name of that droid back on Drongar. 
He knew it was going to bug him all 
day.

 CONSTRUCTION SITE BETA-
NINE, DEATH STAR
 
 The man dressed in black with the 
respirator helmet felt to Teela like 
something out of a long-forgotten 
nightmare. She could almost sense 
evil radiating from him in pulsing 
waves; just being near him made her 
queasy, set her stomach roiling.
 And for all that, she was not even his 
focus, merely one of the retinue of 
architects and builders standing in the 
background as Grand Moff Tarkin 
arrived with the tour to show off this 
part of the station. She had not spoken 
to Vader, nor he to her, but still she 
felt the way she imagined an insect 
under a magnifying lens might feel if 
it looked up and saw a giant eye 
staring down at it. Vader had his back 
to her, and yet she could feel his 
attention as a kind of dark pressure, as 
if a cold hand had been laid on her 
shoulder.
 It made her want to walk away. No, 
it made her want to run away, to get 
as far from here as she could, as 
quickly as she could. She'd never felt 
such a heavy sense of foreboding. The 
opposite side of the battle station 
wouldn't be far enough to run. But to 
attempt such a thing would be a bad 
career move for anybody, and more so 
for a criminal paroled as a trustee.
 Tarkin was droning on about 
something to do with firepower, 
pointing at turbolaser emplacements, 
and Vader seemed to be listening. But 
Teela knew, somehow, that his focus 
was not on the Moff's speech. He was 
probing the minds of those around 
them, examining them, and finding 
them . . .  lacking something.
 Abruptly she became aware that his 
full attention had arrived at her. Of a 
moment, she felt as if she had been 
stripped naked, both her mind and 
body, and that Vader, like the 
imagined scientist examining the 
insect pinned under his lens, beheld 
her in all her being?the good, the 
bad, the flaws, the strengths . . .  
everything that made her who she 
was.
 Instinctively, she threw up a mental 
wall, a shield to prevent the intrusion, 
as though slamming a blast door shut. 
She did it by envisioning just that: a 
heavy durasteel portal closing, the 
shaft locks sliding into their collars, 
the perimeter flange sealing. She'd 
always had a vivid imagination?a 
big reason why she was successful in 
her chosen field? and she could see, 
in her mind's eye, every seam and 
seal, every weld and rivet on the 
hatch, could hear the solid, echoing 
boom! it made as it shut, could even 
feel the vibration. Just before it 
closed, she thought she felt a small 
hint of something from Vader's 
thoughts: surprise.
 And . . .  curiosity.
 But?that was impossible. How 
could she feel someone else's 
thoughts?
 It had to have been her imagination, 
Teela thought. But a moment later the 
tall figure turned and looked directly 
at her. The lenses in the black helmet 
hid his eyes, but there was no doubt?
he had marked her.
 It wasn't just her imagination.
 Teela held her gaze as steady as she 
could, and kept her mental wall in 
place.
 A moment passed. It seemed like a 
long time, but it couldn't have been 
more than a few heartbeats. Vader 
seemed to nod slightly, then turned 
back to look at whatever it was that 
Tarkin was prattling on about.
 The removal of his attention was like 
a glass shell shattering about her. 
Teela nearly collapsed. She gasped, 
loud enough to cause several of her 
colleagues to glance at her. She felt 
shaken to her core.
 What had just happened?



SLASHTOWN PRISON COLONY, 
DESPAYRE
 
 Ratua considered his options, or at 
least what he thought they might be, 
and found them less satisfactory every 
time he recounted them. Only one 
held any appeal at all, and that one not 
so much.
 As he saw things, he could either 
spend the rest of his life on this 
tropical pesthole of a world, until one 
day somebody or something killed 
him . . . 
 Or he could leave.
 That is, he could try. The stats were 
as simple as they were depressing: 
nobody lived to a ripe old age on the 
prison planet and shuffled off 
peacefully in their sleep. Nobody. 
Either some horrible local disease 
took them, or somebody wanted their 
boots, or something with fangs and 
poison-tipped claws looking for a 
meal got too close, and that was just 
how it was. Despayre was a hard 
place, and sooner or later you were 
grub food, even if you were as fast as 
Ratua was.
 He was in his shack, alone and 
brooding. The pitiful interior was 
illuminated by a glow stick, which 
gave barely enough light to show the 
backless chair, the large cable spool 
that served as his table, with his 
cracked plate and two mismatched 
and chipped mugs, and the crab spider 
as big as his hand nestled in one of the 
upper corners near the roof. Night had 
fallen, and the predators that liked the 
dark were out hunting. Some were 
prisoners, some animals, and none of 
them was apt to wish you well. And 
yet for the path Ratua needed to be 
upon, he would have to venture out in 
the night. Moreover, he was going to 
have to do it real soon, because the 
only chance he had of getting off this 
rock was the tiniest of loopholes that 
could close at any moment. The effort 
would cost him everything he 
owned?which wasn't much, and that 
was part of the problem?and if he 
failed, yet still somehow survived, he 
would be starting over again from 
point zero, with nothing save the 
clothes he was wearing.
 Ratua sighed, staring at the 
makeshift wall of his hut. Was the life 
here worse than the risk of trying to 
leave it? Nothing ventured, nothing 
gained, but also nothing lost . . . 
 A tap on the door interrupted his 
meditation. He grabbed his capacitor, 
walked two steps to the entrance, and 
peered out through the peephole. The 
capacitor, salvaged from a broken gel-
cam's battery pack, wasn't much of a 
weapon. It required contact with an 
attacker, which was closer than Ratua 
wanted to be against somebody with a 
knife, say, but it was better than 
nothing. The device, once triggered, 
built up an electrical charge within a 
couple of seconds. The amperage was 
low, but there was still enough 
voltage to knock a full-sized human 
onto his backside?assuming you 
could touch bare skin with the contact 
points. His quickness made it a 
somewhat better weapon than it might 
be in the hands of someone with 
normal reactions, but it was good for 
only a single zap before it had to be 
recharged, which would be far too 
slow in a fight if you couldn't stall the 
attack long enough to let the juice 
build back up.
 As good a scrounger as he was, he 
had never been able to score a blaster. 
Not that he'd tried all that much. 
Carrying a firearm wasn't the best 
way to keep under the radar. Still, 
there were times, like now, when he 
regretted not having scrounged 
harder.
 He glanced through the tiny fish-eye 
lens in the door, salvaged from the 
same cam as the capacitor, and 
relaxed. It was Brun, the cargo crew 
boss on the night shift. The one he'd 
been expecting.
 Ratua opened the door, checked to 
make sure nobody was behind Brun, 
and quickly shut and barred the door 
behind the man.
 Brun was human, kind of; he looked 
like nothing so much as a normal-
sized male who'd been sat upon by 
something large and heavy. His trunk 
was shaped like a canister, and his 
head was almost wider than it was 
tall. He was from some planet that 
Ratua had never heard of before 
they'd met. Brun had been on the 
prison world for years, and had 
worked his way up to a position of 
some trust in that he was allowed 
inside the compound to help in the 
loading and unloading of cargo 
supplies for the dirtside guard posts.
 The only way off the world was by 
ship, and the guard supply craft were 
the most likely conveyances. There 
had been organized breaks in which 
whole ships had been commandeered, 
but that was, in Ratua's considered 
opinion, stupid past the point of 
suicidal. The Empire had all kinds of 
firepower up there, and they weren't 
shy about using it if they knew a 
transport had gone rogue. That had 
happened six months or so ago, and 
there hadn't been any survivors of that 
attempted escape.
 If you couldn't sneak past, you 
weren't going to get very far. And in a 
stand-up with Imperial warships, you 
were going to lose.
 Brun was not a man for pleasantries. 
"Krovvy me th' bitska, floob. M'hitch 
revs inna cyke."
 Whatever world Brun was from was 
either too far out on the Rim for a 
decent education program, or its 
indigent population really didn't care 
about being understood all that much. 
After months of conversation, Ratua 
had picked up enough of Brun's patois 
to understand the gist of his statement, 
which was something along the lines 
of Tell me your idea, friend. My shift 
starts in an hour. The term floob was 
considerably less benign than 
"friend," but Ratua was willing to 
overlook that. He pointed at one of 
the two chairs. As Bran sat, the wood 
creaking under his weight, Ratua went 
to his stashbox and came out with a 
bottle of wine. It wasn't a great wine, 
but it was from offworld and not a 
local vintage, so it was better by far 
than what was available to most 
prisoners. Ratua had been saving it for 
a special occasion, and this was about 
as special as it was going to get.
 He unsealed the cap and poured 
some in the two mugs, handing one to 
his guest.
 "Starry," Brun said, tasting it. Not 
bad.
 "Keep the bottle."
 Brun nodded. '"Shuwan?" What do 
you want?
 Ratua took a deep breath, composing 
himself as best he could. Nothing 
ventured, nothing . . .  "I want you to 
get me onto the supply ship before it 
leaves in the morning."
 A long heartbeat of silence; then 
Brun laughed, shook his bread-loaf-
shaped head, had another sip of the 
wine, and replied, to Ratua's surprise, 
in perfectly understandable Basic, "I 
can do that, but what's the point? It's 
not going anywhere except back to 
the freighter parked up in geosync. 
Any ship leaving the system'll be 
scanned down to the rivets, and 
you've probably heard that none has 
been leaving lately. You can't go 
anywhere, Ratua. Life in a warehouse 
won't be any better than here. You do 
know that every now and then, they 
open the doors to vac and let it get 
real cold in the noncritical storage 
units? Just to get rid of, uh, vermin?"
 Ratua shrugged. "Yeah, I know." He 
wasn't going to stay in the stores area, 
but he saw no point in telling Brun his 
plans. The less the squat humanoid 
knew, the better. "Let me worry about 
that. Do we have a?"
 Brun waved the cup. "Hold up, hold 
up. Haven't said I'd do it. If they catch 
you alive and you give me up, I'm 
back in the pack, with no perks. Why 
would I risk that?"
 Ratua had expected him to make just 
that point. He went back to his 
stashbox and dug out a small 
electronic device, which he showed to 
Brun. "Know what this is?"
 Brun was in for a raft of crimes, one 
of which was piracy, specializing in 
stripping and then reselling the 
electronics from captured ships. He 
nodded. "Looks like an embedder."
 "Exactly right. Onetime spy-killer. 
Check it out." He handed it to Brun to 
examine.
 "Where'd you get this?"
 "You know me; here, there, I get 
around."
 Brun nodded again. That was Ratua's 
talent, everybody knew that. He could 
scrounge just about anything. Brun 
touched some controls on the hand-
sized device and nodded at the 
readout. "Charge is up. Looks good. 
How much you want for it?"
 "Not for sale. It's your guarantee," 
Ratua said. "I'll let you embed me and 
set the implant to your name."
 Brun looked thoughtful. With a spy-
killer installed, Brun didn't need to 
worry much about Ratua ratting him 
out if he was caught. The embed unit, 
about the size of a baby's fingernail, 
would sit harmlessly in Ratua's skull 
for the rest of his life. But it would be 
tuned to a certain word, and if that 
word was spoken by Ratua, and only 
Ratua, the device would explode. Not 
much of an explosion?just enough to 
fry his brain up nice and crispy.
 "So what do I get out of it?"
 Ratua waved at the interior of the 
shack. "I've got some prime stuff 
here?food, drink, electronics, death 
sticks. And I'll give you a list of my 
dealers. I'm gone, they'll talk to you; 
there's nobody else. It's worth a lot."
 "All that'll happen is you'll freeze to 
death up there."
 "That's my worry. Do we have a 
deal?"
 Brun sat there, his short, thick legs 
barely reaching the floor, wine cup in 
one hand and embedder in the other. 
Ratua knew he was weighing the 
risks. There were some, yes?but if 
Ratua was dead, he wouldn't be 
pointing fingers. Greed fought with 
worry, and Ratua watched the battle 
play out on Brun's face.
 Greed won.
 "All right. South Gate, midnight, and 
keep out of sight until you see me. 
You see anybody else with me, stay 
away."
 Ratua let out the breath he'd been 
holding. "Done."
 "Don't pack a big bag," Brun added. 
"Now turn around."
 Ratua took the last drink of his wine 
and did as he was told. Brun put the 
embedder's muzzle against the back of 
Ratua's head; he could feel the cold 
pressure, and then a moment of mild 
pain as Brun injected the unit into his 
skull.
 "So," Brun said, pocketing the 
embedder, "how do you know I won't 
just kill you anyway?"
 "Because you're not a killer," Ratua 
replied. "One reasonably civilized 
being can usually recognize another."
 Brun grunted. "Lem' scan th' 
fiddymon," he said. Let me see the 
goods. He didn't reply to Ratua's
