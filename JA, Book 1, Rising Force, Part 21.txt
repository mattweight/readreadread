Chapter 21

"There my friend," Qui-Gon said to the draigon. He pointed toward the caves.

The dozen passages to the cavern were all set within a single hill, and from the sky the cave mouths looked like wormholes.

Qui-Gon fought to control the draigon's mind, bring it safely to the ground. He was worried. As far as the eye could see, draigons flocked toward the caves.

Their roars were deafening as they called to each other.

Qui-Gon had seen the giant trees in the Silver Forest of Dreams on the planet Kubindi. Some of their vast leaves could be twenty meters wide, and when they fell in the autumn, they floated like giant rafts through the sky. That is what the draigons reminded him of. They dropped through the leaden skies, just as the leaves floated from the Kubindi forests.

Yet these creatures were deadly; and like Qui-Gon, they were headed toward the caves.

Qui-Gon called with his mind, warning young Obi-Wan Kenobi again of the danger.

Then he waited as the draigon wafted downward, close to the narrow ledge outside the caves. Qui-Gon chose his moment, then sprang off the back of the beast. He landed on the ledge, steadying himself with a hand against the outside wall of the cave. The draigon flew off with a soft confused cry, his mind released.

Qui-Gon had taken two steps toward the cave when he saw Obi-Wan race from its mouth, lightsaber held high.

 Obi-Wan ran from the cave only to stop short. He stared at the sky in horror.

At first, he'd thought it was just dark clouds. But now he realized that scores of draigons were blocking the sun. And they were all winging toward the caves.

Never in his young life had he imagined such terror. His legs went weak, and his mind was suddenly blank. He didn't know what to do.

The he saw Qui-Gon heading toward him. Relief flooded him. The Jedi looked battered and bloody, and he was holding one shoulder stiffly. Still, he was alive.

"Did you get the dactyl?" Obi-Wan called.

Qui-Gon nodded. "The Arconans?"

"Still alive, but barely. Go, Qui-Gon. I'll hold the mouth of the cave."

Obi-Wan expected Qui-Gon to argue, to send him back into the cave with the dactyl. The Jedi Knight merely gazed at him for a tenth of a second. In the master's eyes, Obi-Wan saw respect and acceptance.

"I will return," Qui-Gon promised, and rushed into the caves.

In seconds, the draigons were on Obi-Wan. His lightsaber slashed and burned, sizzled and shrieked. Draigons roared in pain and fell before him. He was fighting better and stronger than he ever had, ever thought he could.

But he knew he could not hold the draigons off for long.

 Qui-Gon raced through the caves, past Whiphid and Hutt guards, carrying his bag of dactyl.

Such was the look of purpose in his eyes that no one dared to stop him.

Instead, Jemba's guards cowered in fear, until Qui-Gon, halfway through the tunnel, meet Jemba himself.

"Halt!" the enormous Hutt ordered. "Where are you going?"

Qui-Gon stared evenly at Jemba. You had better get your guard to the mouths of the caves," Qui-Gon warned. "We're in trouble."

"Hah!" Jemba laughed. "Your foolish pupil already tried that trick!"

Suddenly a draigon roared near the mouth of the tunnels. The sound was astonishing. The cave trembled. Bits of dust shook loose from the roof.

"It has started," Qui-Gon said evenly.

He shouldered past the enormous Hutt and raced to get the dactyl to the Arconans.

 Grelb squeezed between two flat rocks and lay for a moment, his heavy blaster in hand, staring down at the caves. He'd missed his chance to kill Qui-Gon Jinn.

The big Jedi had already raced into the caves. But his pupil guarded the moth of the cavern, lightsaber ready.

He wanted the Master, but the pupil would have to do for now.

Draigons hurtled from the sky by the dozens, converging on the lad. Even Grelb had to admire the young Jedi's skill. His lightsaber struck again and again, and the boy showed no sign of tiring. It was almost a pity to kill him.

Lightning split the sky. Rain pounded the stones over Grelb's head. One good thing about hiding under these rocks Â– at least it was dry.

He raised his blaster rifle and tried to aim at the young Jedi. The boy's lightsaber flashed among the draigons.

All I need now, Grelb thought, is one brief moment to pull of my shot. Just one . . .
