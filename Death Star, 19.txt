 Memah thought about it. The sarge 
was right. Even with just one Death 
Star operational, the Rebellion 
wouldn't stand a chance. Build a 
whole fleet of them, and the Empire 
would have the galaxy gripped in a 
durasteel hand forever.
 She saw Nova wince. "You okay, 
Sarge?" she asked.
 "Got a headache that won't quit. 
Maybe I can kill it with this 
embalming fluid you sell here. Next 
round's on me," he said. "We can toast 
the end of the war."
 "It's not over yet," Rodo said.
 "Only a matter of time," Nova said.



COMMAND CENTER, OVERBRIDGE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 "You're confident of this?" Motti 
nodded. "Yes, sir. The interior is not 
finished, but the hull is patent and the 
hyperdrives will be ready shortly. 
Enough for a partial shakedown."
 "Good. Since the Rebels know our 
location, we cannot risk staying in the 
same system until we are at full 
readiness."
 "Prudent."
 "And the superlaser?"
 "Engineering tells me that we can 
manage thirty percent power and, 
after a fast capacitor recharge for an 
hour or two, that much again."
 "How strong will that beam be?"
 Motti shrugged. "Theoretical. 
Nobody knows for sure."
 "Well, then we need to test it before 
we embark."
 "That would be wise. Do you have a 
target in mind?"
 Tarkin smiled. "Yes. I do."
 Motti wanted to ask how Daala was 
faring, to show concern, but it didn't 
seem appropriate to bring it up just 
now. Besides, he already knew. She 
had suffered some kind of memory 
damage and was already on a fast ship 
back to the Maw. Tarkin might be 
besotted with her, but he wasn't a total 
fool. He knew it would unwise to risk 
Vader or the Emperor finding out she 
had been here against orders.
 Well, no matter. Even though the 
ship wasn't quite ready for full-scale 
battle maneuvers, Motti would have it 
running well enough in a matter of 
days.
 What target did the old man have in 
mind, though? There weren't any to 
choose from here; they'd pretty much 
scoured the system clean. There were 
two Bespin-class gas giants, one in an 
outer orbit, the other a sun skimmer, 
but they were too big to be practical. 
They needed a solar body at least big 
enough for its own gravity to crush it 
into spherical shape. Something that 
size would be the only way to 
calculate how powerful the beam 
would be at a third of its projected 
strength.



CUBE 24556, RESIPLEX 19, SPRAWL 20, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Vil leaned back on the couch next to 
Teela, feeling distracted. "So how was 
your shift?" he asked.
 "Pretty good. The crews finished two 
sets of officers' quarters, another five-
hundred-person barracks, and a rec 
center. It's amazing to stand on an 
overlook and see these things just sort 
of appear in a matter of days."
 "Sounds like you're pleased."
 "Oh, I am. It's not the job I would 
have chosen, working on a battle 
station, but it's what I've been handed. 
And there is a sense of 
accomplishment in taking a standard 
design and tweaking it so it costs less 
and works more efficiently."
 "That's great. Congratulations."
 "What's wrong?"
 He looked at her. How could she 
know? He hadn't been in all that many 
relationships, and the ones he'd been 
in had usually been short and shallow. 
Teela noticed things that none of the 
others had seemed to catch.
 "Nothing."
 She grinned at him. "You might be 
able to fly, Vil, but that won't. What's 
up?"
 He shifted uncomfortably. "I can't 
really talk about it."
 "You mean the battle yesterday?"
 "How do you know about that?"
 "It's a big station, but people do talk 
to each other. Word gets around."
 He signed. "Yeah, I guess. Well, I 
was part of it."
 "And?"
 "I made double ace. You know what 
that means?"
 "No."
 "I shot down ten enemy fighters."
 She sighed. "I'm not a fan of war, 
but that's your job, isn't it? Wouldn't 
congratulations be in order?"
 "Yeah."
 "But?"
 Vil looked at her. Could he really 
talk about this with her? Yes, he 
decided. He could. There really was 
something different about her, 
something that said she would 
understand, even if she didn't 
necessarily approve.
 "It wasn't as much fun as I always 
thought it would be."
 She looked at him with an 
unreadable expression. "I wouldn't 
think that killing people would be."
 "You can't think of them as people, 
just as the enemy. It's not that. It was . 
. . too easy."
 She leaned back and blinked at him. 
"Too easy?"
 "It was like shooting at targets. They 
were so intent on getting to the 
station, they didn't offer much of a 
fight. We cut them to pieces."
 "I don't get it. You wanted them to 
shoot at you?"
 "No, no. Well?yes. I mean, I 
wanted to survive, of course. I wanted 
to win, but I wanted it to be ... I know 
it sounds stupid, but I wanted to have 
to work harder."
 Teela sighed. "I understand."
 He looked at her in surprise. "You 
do?"
 "Sure. Nobody wants to skate along 
the easy path all the time. You wanted 
a challenge, so you could feel like 
you'd accomplished something."
 "Yeah. Sometimes long odds are the 
only ones worth playing."
 "Well, I can't say I'm sorry it wasn't 
more dangerous. Besides, I assume 
there'll be more battles?"
 Vil shook his head. "Maybe not. 
Knowing that Tarkin could just pull 
up and blow the whole world right out 
of the sky? I think wars are going to 
be a thing of the past pretty quick."
 Teela looked puzzled. "And that's 
bad because . . . ?"
 "Well, it's not?not for civilization, 
of course not. Big picture and all that. 
But for lighter pilots? We're going to 
be put out to pasture."
 "You could get a job flying 
commercial spacecraft."
 "I had it in mind that if I survived, 
someday I would do that. But. . . not 
yet."
 She put her arms around him and 
pulled him closer to her. "You don't 
always get your first choice in life. 
Things happen, you have to adjust. 
Nobody knows that better than I do."
 He nodded.
 "But if you wanted to be an ace, now 
you are one. That's something. 
Congratulations."
 "Well, a double ace, if you want get 
technical about it."
 "Oh, yeah, let's you and me get 
technical, hey?"
 Vil laughed. There was definitely 
something different about this one.

THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DECK 69, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Ratua had trouble jamming his way 
into the cantina. It was packed, and he 
understood why. A lot of celebrating 
was going on. The encounter with the 
Rebel carrier was all over the station, 
and if the TIE pilots involved had 
been cocky before, they would be 
strutting a lot prouder after that 
victory.
 He wasn't political, and who won the 
war didn't matter much to him, except 
that being here meant they'd be 
moving away from the prison world, 
and eventually back to civilization. 
And it would be the safest of safe 
rides. So all this was to the good.
 He saw Memah working frenetically 
behind the bar. Even with all the 
droids and servers on duty, he knew 
he wouldn't get much of a chance to 
visit with her this shift.
 Ah, well. He certainly didn't 
begrudge her the work. The crowd 
would thin, eventually.
 Meanwhile, his latest scam was 
getting ripe. A few more days and 
he'd be rolling in credits. Well, maybe 
not. But certainly he'd have enough to 
cover the walls of his cube, with 
plenty left over to outfit the ceiling 
and deck.
 
 
 
ISD DEVASTATOR, OFF 
PLANETTATOOINE, ARKANIS SECTOR, 
WILD SPACE
 
 "What is thy bidding, my Master?" 
Vader kneeled in front of the holo 
projector, offering obeisance to the 
larger-than-life-sized image of the 
Dark Lord of the Sith.
 As always, his Master's voice was as 
brittle as crystalline hydrogen. "You 
have recovered the plans for the 
Death Star?"
 "Not yet, Master. I know where they 
are and I'll have them soon."
 "I have every faith in you, Lord 
Vader."
 Vader inclined his head in a military 
bow. He felt a sense of pride. Praise 
from his Master was infrequent, and 
therefore to be relished.
 "I have dissolved the Imperial 
Senate," Sidious continued. "You will 
return to the battle station and convey 
this to Tarkin." He paused. "I want 
Tarkin to know how important I think 
this is, that I would send you in 
person."
 "Yes, my Master."
 "The station is nearly operational, 
and I would have it made completely 
so as soon as possible."
 "I will see to it."
 "And once you have gotten whatever 
information you can from Senator 
Organa, you will terminate her?"
 "Yes."
 "Good, good. There are strange 
currents in the Force, Lord Vader, 
swirling about so that even I cannot 
see the future, save through a hazy 
pall. We must move with great care 
until things become clearer."
 "Yes, Master."
 The holo blinked off, and Vader 
stood. His Master's expression of 
confidence notwithstanding, the 
conversation had been disquieting. 
The Emperor was the most powerful 
Sith in a thousand years, and he was 
always confident, always in control, 
able to manipulate complex situations 
as he saw fit with a celerity that was, 
to any uninitiated into the dark side of 
the Force, nothing less than 
astonishing. There were wheels within 
wheels, cogs great and small, and 
Emperor Palpatine was the master 
machinist who ran all of them.
 And yet he had sounded concerned . 
. . What could possibly concern so 
powerful a personage?
 Vader's agents would recover the 
jettisoned escape pod from Tatooine. 
Meanwhile he had been ordered to go 
to the Death Star, and that was where 
he would go.



SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, THETA 
SECTOR, DEATH STAR
 
 The CO looked grim, and Tenn 
understood why. He was feeling 
pretty grim himself. He would do his 
job, that wasn't even in question?he 
was too much the career navy man to 
do anything else. But he had to say 
something.
 "You're serious?"
 "Not really something I'd joke about, 
is it?"
 Tenn felt like he'd just fallen down a 
pooka hole into some bizarre fantasy 
world. "For practice? Just to see how 
well it'll work?"
 "Engineering hasn't gotten itself 
together, from what they tell me. 
They say thirty-three percent power is 
all they can currently store in the 
capacitors for discharge. We need to 
see if that's true."
 "What'll it do?"
 "Nobody really knows. Nothing has 
been run up even close to that hot 
before." There was an awkward 
pause. Then the CO said, "You okay 
with this, Chief? Because I can get 
Beller or Reshias up here?"
 Tenn raised his hand. "I'm good, 
Cap. Not my job to decide where or 
when, it's to put the spike where they 
want it. Still ..."
 Still, it's one thing to vaporize an 
enemy troop carrier or Rebel base, 
and quite another to destroy an entire 
world.
 "I hear you, Chief. But that's how it 
is."
 "Yeah." Tenn straightened and 
squared his shoulders. "When?"
 "Test is set up for eleven hundred 
hours."
 Tenn looked at the timer on the 
control wall. Two hours. "No 
problem," he said.



COMMAND CENTER, OVERBRIDCE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Motti wasn't really surprised when 
Tarkin told him of his decision, but he 
immediately saw the potential for 
problems. He voiced his concerns?
circumspectly, of course.
 "I understand your apprehension," 
Tarkin said. "But I believe the 
political fallout will be minimal." 
"Still, why risk even that?"
 "Because, as you well know, we 
cannot go into battle without knowing 
what our biggest weapon will do 
when we need to use it."
 Motti nodded. Tarkin was right. One 
always tested one's weapons. How 
and where, however, were different 
questions.
 It's not your decision, Motti told 
himself. A fact for which he was 
profoundly grateful. Aloud, he said, 
"You're the Grand Moff."
 "Indeed I am."


55




THE HARD HEART CANTINA, DECK 69, 
DEATH STAR
 
 The cantina was closed; the air-
purifying system was being cleaned 
and the ionizers balanced. It was 
noisy, but with the door closed to her 
office, the sound of the droid cleaners 
was muted enough so that Memah and 
Ratua could have a conversation.
 Ratua had the smug smile that she'd 
come to know over the last few 
months. "What have you done now, 
Green-Eyes? You look entirely too 
pleased with yourself."
 "Merely supplied a basic human 
need," he said.
 "Right. C'mon, tell Aunt Memah."
 "Nobody got hurt," he said, a bit too 
quickly. "Nobody will even miss a 
meal, trust me here. Everybody is 
happy. The quartermaster merely 
diverted a shipment of electronics and 
holoprojectors that would likely have 
sat in a storage bin for ten years doing 
nothing, because everything on this 
station is backed up at least twice 
already. The chances of them ever 
needing any of that gear are close to 
zero."
 "Uh-huh." She wondered why she 
was even bothering to listen to him 
justifying himself. Theft was theft, no 
matter the circumstances. But she 
knew why she listened. As long as he 
kept talking she could gaze into those 
green eyes.
 "No, look, it's true. It's not doing 
anybody any good, and there is this 
market out there for entertainment?
people are bored out of their heads in 
some sectors."
 "And what are you going to show on 
these entertainment systems you, ah, 
liberated? Skin holos?"
 "No, no, nothing like that!" He 
sounded honestly affronted by the 
thought. "We're talking sports, 
crashball, low-g gymnastics, 
Podracing. Good, clean, family 
programs."
 "And why can't people see those on 
the station's regular entertainment 
communications gear?"
 "Well, they can?but those terminals 
are set up where the designers want 
them. Think about the poor guy who's 
working in some dark warehouse out 
on the Rim and gone away from any 
holo-unit. Sodder's stacking boxes 
with a grav-loader all day?boring, 
mind-numbing work. No 
entertainment terminals there. What's 
wrong with him having a little viewer 
on his loader, so that he can sneak a 
peek at his favorite team when he has 
a break?"
 "Or ram his loader into a wall 
because he's watching the 'proj 
instead of paying attention to where 
he's going?"
 He smiled at her. "Well, that's not 
my problem. I sell them a knife, they 
can use it to slice their vege-steaks or 
they can stab themselves in the leg. 
None of my biz."
 She laughed. She couldn't help it. 
Celot Ratua Dil was a bad boy, true 
enough, but he was so disarmingly 
honest about his dishonesty.
 "Check it out," he said, obviously 
relieved at her laughter. He produced 
a device the size of his fist and set in 
on her desk, then activated it. The 
three-dimensional hologram of the 
station's entertainment net appeared 
over the 'projector.
 "Aside from the regular channels, 
this particular unit can tap into the 
external cam feeds. Watch."
 He touched the device, dialed up the 
magnification, and the image of a 
planet shimmered into view, about the 
size of a crashball.
 "My old stomping grounds," he said. 
"Despayre. A terrible place to visit, 
and in fact you couldn't anyway, 
'cause once you're there, you're there. 
But it looks nice from this far away." 
He cocked his head in consideration 
of the green-and-blue image. "No, 
actually, it still looks awful."
 Memah glanced at the chron inset 
into the 'proj. Almost eleven
 hundred. The maintenance droids 
should be finishing the filters pretty 
soon, which was good, because she 
wanted to be open again by mid-shift, 
and it would take at least another hour 
to?
 A flash of pale green glimmered 
briefly from the holo.
 The room shook, vibrating enough to 
rattle the chairs. She felt her viscera 
become momentarily buoyant, and 
realized that the ship's gravity field 
had flickered.
 "What is that?" Memah stood, 
fighting sudden, inexplicable panic. 
After all, what could possibly pose a 
danger to?
 Ratua held up a hand to quiet her. 
Those green eyes watched the 'proj. 
"Wait a second," he said. 
"Something's wrong."
 The image of the planet Despayre 
seemed to shiver as a thin beam of 
emerald green?nearly the same color 
as Ratua's eyes, she thought? from 
off the edge of the 'proj lanced into 
the center of the single huge 
continent.
 They both watched disbelievingly as 
an orange spot blossomed on the 
image of the planet. It seemed no 
bigger than Memah's thumbnail at 
first, but it grew rapidly, spreading in 
an expanding circle. The center of the 
orange turned black.
 "Kark," Ratua said. He sounded 
stunned.
 "What? What is it?"
 "They?they're firing at the planet. 
With the superlaser."
 The orange and black spread in 
irregular waves now, continuing 
outward from the center. The blue of 
the ocean didn't even slow it down.
 "The atmosphere's on fire," Ratua 
said. Calmly, as if he were discussing 
the weather. Going to be a warm day 
today, temperature around five 
thousand degrees . . .
 She felt a horrifying urge to laugh. It 
didn't seem real?it couldn't be real. 
Ratua must've tuned in to some 
future-fic holo by mistake. It wasn't a 
real planet she was watching burn. 
No. Things like that just didn't 
happen.
 Memah stared at the image. She 
could not look away.



SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, THETA 
SECTOR, DEATH STAR
 
 Tenn looked at the images from the 
targeting cam. He still had his hand 
on the firing lever. He released it and 
stared, watching as the very air on the 
prison world caught fire in a runaway 
planetary holocaust. Seismographic 
sensors showed that massive 
groundquakes had begun, rumbling 
down into the bowels of the planet. 
Giant waves in the ocean, generated 
by the shifting of tectonic plates, 
rushed for the shores of the big 
continent. Volcanoes spewed lava. 
Clouds of steam and volcanic ash 
began to rapidly obscure the surface 
from view?but not fast enough.
 He had just killed everything on the 
planet Despayre. If all life wasn't dead 
already, it would be soon.
 The CO moved to look over his 
shoulder. He didn't congratulate Tenn 
on the shot; he just stood there.
 "Stang," Tenn said.
 The CO nodded. "Yeah."



COMMAND CENTER, OVERBRIDGE, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Motti said, "Engineering says the 
capacitors will be recharged in an 
hour and thirteen minutes."
 Tarkin watched the projection as the 
effects of the beam manifested on the 
planet. By the time the second pulse 
was ready for discharge, there 
wouldn't be anything alive on the 
world below them to care. The chain 
reaction was massive. And at only 
one-third of the power that would be 
available when it was fully 
operational.
 Amazing.
 "I hope you're right about this," 
Motti said. "Politically, I mean."
 "Of course I am, Admiral. The 
population of that world consisted of 
condemned criminals sentenced to life 
imprisonment. They were never going 
back to civilization. It was a constant 
drain on Imperial resources to 
transport them and to maintain them. 
Those troops will now be freed up for 
service. Nobody will mourn the 
murderers or the filthy planet on 
which they lived."
 "And where will the Empire send its 
major criminals now?"
 Tarkin turned away from the images 
of carnage and looked directly at 
Motti. "Unless I am seriously 
mistaken, the death penalty will be 
used more frequently. Imperial justice 
is about to become swift and sure, 
Admiral."
 He turned back to watch the image 
of the dying world.



G-12 BARRACKS, SECTOR N-SEVEN, 
DEATH STAR
 
 Nova woke up screaming, beset with 
horror. The other sergeants watched 
him, but none of them approached. 
Bad idea to get too close to a martial 
arts expert coming out of a nightmare.
 Nova tried to calm himself, to slow 
his breathing, but he had never felt 
anything like this before. It was as if 
he had heard a million people cry out, 
all at once, as they were killed.
 He stepped from his cot, went to the 
refresher, and washed his face. He 
needed to see that doctor again. He 
was beyond caring what anyone 
thought. Something was definitely 
wrong with him, and he couldn't live 
like this.


56




SUPERLASER FIRE CONTROL, THETA 
SECTOR, DEATH STAR
 
 An hour and fifteen minutes after the 
first beam, Tenn fired the second one.
 The planet Despayre, already 
scorched lifeless and beset with 
cataclysmic groundquakes and 
volcanism, began to shake like some 
tormented creature in its death throes. 
Massive cracks, thousands of 
kilometers long and tens of klicks 
wide, striated the world. Mountains 
collapsed in one hemisphere as they 
jutted up and rose in another. It was 
impossible to see all this directly, of 
course, because of the cloud cover 
that had blanketed the surface, but the 
IR and VSI scopes showed everything 
all too clearly. The molten core of the 
globe, already venting through 
innumerable new volcanoes, oozed to 
the surface and produced oceans of 
lava that spread across the land. This 
was how the planet had been born, 
and this was how it was dying.
 An hour and nineteen minutes later, 
when Tenn fired the third beam that 
blew the charred and burned-out 
cinder apart, shattering it into billions 
of pieces, it seemed almost pointless. 
Everybody and everything on it had 
already been roasted, scalded, or 
drowned. The system's gravity twisted 
as the planetary well ceased to exist. 
Shield sensors quietly recorded the 
thousands of fragments, from the size 
of pebbles to that of mountains, 
deflected from the station.
 Sweet Queen Quinella. A whole 
planet, destroyed. Just like that. No 
matter how tough you thought you 
were, that was hard to stomach.
 Especially when you were the one 
who had pulled the lever.
 
 
 
ISD DEVASTATOR, APPROACHING 
DEATH STAR
 
 Vader had felt the fabric of the Force 
tear even in hyperspace. Some vast 
and terrible event had taken place. 
When they'd dropped below 
lightspeed, it had taken but a few 
seconds for his sensor crew to 
determine the cause of that event.
 The prison planet of Despayre was 
no more.
 Vader nodded to himself as he 
looked at the magnified view of 
planetary debris. That should 
convince the military that they had 
developed the ultimate weapon. They 
were wrong, but they would believe 
it. They would be full of their pitiful 
dreams of power and glory, unable to 
comprehend the truth, certain that 
they were unbeatable.
 That was not his worry. He had his 
orders, and he would carry them out. 
He would get the information he 
sought from the dissident Princess. 
They would find the Rebels' main 
base and destroy it. The war would be 
over, and Vader would finally be free 
to resume his studies of the dark side 
in earnest. He had much to learn and, 
with the Emperor no longer 
preoccupied with this petty conflict, 
he could resume his training.
 That was what was important. That 
way lay real power.



MAIN CONFERENCE ROOM, COMMAND 
CENTER, DEATH STAR
 
 Motti wanted to reach over and 
smash in General Tagge's face?the 
man was insufferable! Tagge said, 
"Until this battle station is fully 
operational, we are vulnerable. The 
Rebel Alliance is too well equipped. 
They are more dangerous than you 
realize."
 Motti could have pointed out that the 
vaunted Rebel Alliance had sent a 
huge carrier against the station and 
that unfortunate vessel had been 
blown out of existence by a single, 
low-powered pulse of the not-yet-
fully-operational Death Star's main 
battery, from more than two thousand 
kilometers away. Which was nothing 
compared with the fact that an entire 
planet had just been destroyed with 
three partial-strength pulses, any one 
of which could blow an armada out of 
the galaxy.
 But Tagge already knew this, of 
course. He was putting his objections 
into the record, covering his bets and 
his backside, just in case.
 Two could play that game. Motti 
said, "Dangerous to your starfleet, 
Commander, not to this battle 
station."
 Tagge was as thickheaded as a 
durasteel plate. He just kept prattling 
on: "The Rebellion will continue to 
gain support in the Imperial Senate as 
long as?" He stopped as Grand Moff 
Tarkin, followed closely by Darth 
Vader, strode into the conference 
room. As he entered, Tarkin cut in: 
"The Imperial Senate will no longer 
be of any concern to us. I've just 
received word that the Emperor has 
dissolved the council permanently. 
The last remnants of the Old Republic 
have been swept away."
 Even that didn't shut Tagge up: 
"That's impossible! How will the 
Emperor maintain control without the 
bureaucracy?"
 Tarkin said, "The regional governors 
now have direct control over their 
territories." He smiled, ever so 
slightly. "Fear will keep local systems 
in line?fear of this battle station."
 "And what of the Rebellion?" Tagge 
kept on. The man was like a borrat 
with a bone: he wouldn't let it go. "If 
the Rebels have obtained a complete 
technical readout of this station, it is 
possible, however unlikely, that they 
might find a weakness and exploit it."
 "The plans you refer to will soon be 
back in our hands." That from the 
deep-voiced Vader, who stood behind 
the now seated Tarkin.
 Motti couldn't contain himself any
