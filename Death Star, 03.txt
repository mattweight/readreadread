To be able to reach out a hundred 
klicks or more and smash a ship to 
atomic dust was real power. And 
nobody was better at it than he was.
 Tenn got to the array five minutes 
early, as always. Fifty meters in 
diameter, the unit was quiet as shift 
change neared. He saw Chief Droot 
and nodded at him. "Chief. How're we 
doin'?"
 "Shipshape, Gee." The big Chagrian, 
one of the few aliens to rise to any 
kind of rank in the Imperial Navy, 
glanced around. "You know there's a 
surprise drill at eleven thirty hours?"
 "Yeah."
 "We cleared the decks, got the caps 
charged, ready to blaze."
 Tenn grinned. "Thanks, Droot. I owe 
you one."
 "Nah, I'm still two down?you had 
the station shining like a mirror on 
that last inspection. I got a smile out 
of the admiral himself that time."
 Tenn nodded. Everybody kept track 
of who owed who what on a ship, and 
you didn't let a fellow chief catch flak 
if you could help out. Even if it wasn't 
your watch, it was your station, and 
what made one look bad made them 
all look bad. And vice versa, of 
course.
 "Station's yours," Droot said. "I'm 
gonna go get some supper. I hear the 
mess hall has some berbersian crab on 
the menu."
 "More likely doctored soypro," Tenn 
said.
 Droot shrugged. "Yeah, well, it's the 
navy, not the Yuhuz Four Star." He 
left, ducking to make sure his horns 
cleared the hatch.
 The morning shift crew was already 
in place?CPO Tenn Graneet wanted 
his people onstation fifteen minutes 
early, and if you weren't, you'd be 
sorry. Once, and you got your rump 
chewed like a starved reek was 
gnawing on it. Twice, and you were 
looking for another job.
 "Good morning, people," Tenn said.
 "Morning, Chief," came the echo 
from the crew.
 "Polish your buttons, boys," the 
chief said. "I don't want anything 
sticking just in case we have to shoot 
something today."
 Most of the crew smiled. They all 
knew about the drill. They were all 
ready. None of them wanted to be the 
being who disappointed Master Chief 
Petty Officer Graneet. No, sir . . . 
 

MEDICAL FRIGATE MEDSTAR FOUR, 
POLAR ORBIT, PLANET DESPAYRE
 "Captain Dr. Kornell Divini?" 
 Uli nodded. "Yeah."
 "Medical Technician Class Two 
Vurly, sir," the man said. Human, as 
Uli was, or at least close enough that 
he couldn't tell otherwise, and Uli was 
something of an expert on humanoid 
anatomy.
 "This way, sir."
 The meditech led him down 
featureless gray corridors, deeper into 
the ship, to an office complex. Uli 
marked the route half consciously, 
knowing he could find his way around 
pretty quickly if need be. He had a 
good sense of direction, though it 
wasn't anything he could claim credit 
for?he'd been born that way.
 Sure enough, it was the Medical 
Admin section he found himself in. 
Ships' medical suites all looked alike; 
the same pale off-white walls, wide 
corridors, and color-coded 
luminescent floor stripes that led you 
to various departments. There were a 
dozen or so people working: 
secretaries, mostly, some biologicals, 
some droids. The hands-on medical 
stuff would be done elsewhere down 
the hall, he knew.
 "Commander Hotise, Dr. Kornell 
Divini."
 Hotise was a short, rotund man, 
probably seventy or so, with white 
hair and a cropped beard. He wore 
office grays, and the clothes were cut 
well enough that they had to be 
tailored. He was checking off a list on 
a flatscreen. He looked up, nodded at 
the tech. "Thanks, Vurly."
 The tech nodded, said "Sir," and left.
 "Welcome to MedStar Four, 
Doctor," Hotise said. "Glad to have 
you aboard."
 Uli nodded. "Thank you, sir," he 
said. His apparent lack of enthusiasm 
must have showed. The old man 
cocked an eyebrow that had more hair 
than a leafcrawler.
 "Not happy with this assignment, 
son?"
 That earned Uli's new commander 
an incredulous look. "Not happy? I 
did my first tour in a Rimsoo unit on a 
swamp world where your lungs could 
fill with spores in five minutes if you 
weren't wearing a filter mask. I 
patched up maybe a thousand clones, 
and I was supposed to be rotated back 
to my homeworld and discharged a 
civilian at the end of it. That was . . .  
five? six? hitches ago. I lost track."
 Hotise nodded. "Imslow," he said.
 "That's right." IMSLO stood for 
"Imperial Military Stop Loss Order." 
Too many skilled people who'd been 
drafted had had enough of the military 
after the Clone Wars, and when their 
compulsory service ended, wanted 
nothing more than to go home. With 
the action against the Rebels heating 
up, the Empire couldn't allow that. 
Doctors, in particular, were in short 
supply; hence, IMSLO. A retroactive 
order mandating that, no matter when 
you'd been conscripted, once you 
were in, you were in for as long as 
they wanted you?or until you got 
killed. Either way, it was kiss your 
planned life good-bye.
 Imperial Military Stop Loss Order. 
An alternative translation, scrawled 
no doubt on a 'fresher wall 
somewhere by a clever graffitist, had 
caught on over the last few years: "I'm 
Milking Scragged; Life's Over." The 
memory brought a faint, grim smile to 
Uli's lips.
 "Sorry, son," his CO said. "It's not 
my policy."
 "But you are career navy."
 The older man nodded. "We each 
have our chosen path."
 "Not exactly true, is it? If I was on 
my chosen path, probably you and I 
would never have met."
 Hotise shrugged. "What can I say? I 
don't run things back in civilization?
I just do what I'm told. We were short 
a surgeon. I requisitioned a 
replacement. You're him. You weren't 
here, you'd be someplace else where 
the Empire deemed you necessary.
 "It ain't Imperial Center General or 
Big Zoo, but it's quiet here. Not like a 
Rimsoo tent out in the tall grass. 
Nobody is shooting at us. Most of 
what we see is the occasional 
industrial accident or normal wear and 
tear. You could do better, Captain, but 
you could also do a lot worse. War is 
ugly, but that's how it is."
 "Yes, sir."
 "You can drop that part. We're pretty 
informal around here. I'll have a droid 
show you to your quarters, and you 
can take the tour and settle in." Hotise 
looked at Uli's orders. "Says here 
you're originally from Tatooine, Dr. 
Divini."
 "Uli."
 Hotise squinted at him. "Beg pardon, 
son?"
 "People call me Uli. It's a Tusken 
word?means?"
 An alarm blared, cutting him off. Uli 
didn't need a translation: Incoming!
 A secretary droid rolled up on a 
single wheel. Its gyroscope squeaked 
a little right at the edge of Uli's 
hearing as the spinning wheel kept the 
droid upright and stable. It stopped in 
front of Hotise. "Sir, Ambulance Ship 
Nine is on the way to Dock B with 
twelve workers injured by an oxygen 
tank explosion at the construction 
site."
 Uli noticed that the droid's 
vocabulator had, for whatever reason, 
a kind of musical lilt that he found 
pleasant. It was as though the droid 
were a character from a light opera, 
about to burst into song at any 
moment.
 "It should be arriving in six-point-
five minutes," the droid continued. 
"Field medics list primary damage 
due to compressive injuries, shrapnel 
wounds, and vacuum ruptures. Four 
critical, two of those in shock; three 
moderate; five minor. Species 
breakdown is six Wookiees, three 
humans, one Cerean, one Ugnaught, 
one Gungan."
 Uli frowned. That was an interesting 
mix?six Wookiees? Working for the 
Empire? That didn't seem right.
 "So much for quiet," he said. "Which 
way to Emergency Receiving?"
 "You don't have to jump right in 
yet," Hotise said.
 Uli shrugged. "Might as well. It's 
what I do."
 Hotise nodded. "Fourmio will show 
you." He nodded at the droid. "Leave 
your gear here; I'll have it taken to 
your quarters."
 The droid said, "This way, Dr. 
Divini," in a pleasing tenor. Its wheel 
squeaked as it rolled down the hall. 
Uli followed.

SLASHTOWN PRISON COLONY, GRID 
4354, SECTOR 547, QUADRANT 3, 
PLANET DESPAYRE
 
 As a Zelosian, Celot Ratua Dil 
could, if pressed, live on sunlight and 
water?at least for a while. He didn't 
know his species' origin, but he did 
know that his people all had green 
eyes and green blood. While nobody 
outside the species had ever been 
curious enough to do full genetic 
scans, the theory that there had been 
some unique melding of animal and 
plant in the dawn of Zelosian history 
was accepted as fact on his 
homeworld. Sunlight and a little 
water, and he could go a month, two 
months, without eating a bite, though 
he'd rather not. He'd rather eat a nice 
meal of bahmat steak and feelo eggs, 
and, as long as he was rathering, he'd 
much rather be home on Zelos than on 
a prison world full of nasty criminals.
 Unfortunately, that wasn't how it 
was.
 He looked around the inside of the 
rude hut in which he lived, a 
ramshackle collection of local wood 
and cast-off Imperial packing crates 
lashed together with vines, wire, and 
bits of twine. Not much, but it was 
home. He rolled off the pad he used 
for a bed, essentially a blanket over 
some evergreen boughs. Fresh and 
layered right, it was pretty 
comfortable. The branches were 
getting dry, though; it had been a 
couple of standard weeks since he'd 
changed them. He'd have to do that 
soon;
 not only were dry branches 
uncomfortable, but scorpion slugs 
would quickly infest them, and one 
sting from a slug's tail could cause 
members of just about any humanoid 
species agony for weeks?if they 
were lucky.
 For the thousandth time Ratua 
mentally railed against the bad luck 
that had sent him here. Yes, he was a 
thief, though not much of one. And 
yes, he'd been a smuggler, though he'd 
never made any real credits at it. He 
was a pretty good scrounger, which 
helped him survive here. And he was 
not above taking advantage of a poor 
trader in a spirited transaction now 
and again. But being scooped up in a 
Trigalis port pub that just happened to 
have a pirate gang in it, and being 
lumped in as one of their crew? That 
was wrong. All he had done was stop 
in for a mug of ferment. The fact that 
he had been doing a little haggling 
with one of the pirates over some 
meelweekian silk that had "fallen" 
from a commercial hovervan earlier 
didn't mean he was a member of the 
crew.
 The judges, unfortunately, had not 
been convinced. Ratua had offered to 
undergo a truth-scan, but somebody 
would have to pay for that, as he 
didn't have the coin, and the judges 
weren't willing to spend taxpayers' 
credits when he was so obviously 
guilty of something, even if it wasn't 
this particular crime on this particular 
world. And so he'd been tossed in 
with a crowd of hard-bitten types, all 
of them wedged into a cargo hold not 
big enough for half their number, and 
summarily tossed off the planet.
 Being on a prison planet with some 
seriously bad criminals was not a 
walk in a quiet park. Even without the 
exiled thieves, murderers, 
extortionists, and so on, Despayre 
wouldn't be anyone's first choice to 
build a winter home. The land was 
mostly jungle, consisting of one large 
continent and one considerably larger 
ocean. The rampant growth was 
nourished by a gravity level of less 
than three-quarters a standard g, and 
by seasonal gales that roared in from 
the distant ocean, fueled by tidal 
forces due to the erratic orbit.
 The jungle flora and fauna had 
responded to the environmental 
challenge of the gales by producing 
large, close-knit growth that stabbed 
roots deep into the ground. In some 
places the entwined rain forest was 
totally impenetrable. The animal life 
had adapted as well, by becoming, for 
the most part, sinuous and serpentine, 
the better to forage through the tightly 
interwoven vines and boles. There 
were poisonous crustaceans, as well 
as a few flying creatures such as small 
winged lizards and manta-like things, 
the latter with an interesting life cycle 
that began in the ocean and ended in 
the jungle.
 And everything?everything?
seemed to be the most vicious, 
savage, and generally unpleasant 
representative of its species possible. 
It wasn't so much an interdependent 
ecological system as it was all-out 
biological war, with each of 
Despayre's myriad indigenous species 
seemingly hardwired to attack and 
destroy all others. Everything that 
moved, it seemed, had fangs that 
dripped venom, and everything rooted 
to the ground had poisonous thorns, 
barbs, burrs . . . 
 And on top of all that, there were the 
prisoners.
 The guards, safe in their floating 
patrol barges, were there to make sure 
nobody escaped; short of that, the 
prisoners could do pretty much 
whatever they wanted to one another, 
and not a night went by without 
somebody being thumped, sometimes 
hard enough that they died. It was the 
law of the jungle in here, just as it was 
out there, and the big predators ruled. 
They took what they wanted, and if 
you objected, you got squashed. Ratua 
tried to keep a low profile?if they 
didn't notice you, they weren't as 
likely to take you out just for the sport 
of it. He kept his mouth shut and his 
head down, and concentrated on 
survival.
 He washed his face, using fairly 
clean water in a stasis field generator 
dome, then headed outside. Sergeant 
Nova Stihl, one of the more easygoing 
of the guards, taught a self-defense 
class nearby every morning. Mostly 
the students were other guards, but 
there were some prisoners, and Ratua 
enjoyed watching other people sweat. 
Plus, it was a gathering in which biz 
could be conducted. Swap a little of 
this for a little of that, get by a little 
better. Ratua had a pretty good biz 
going bartering goods and services, 
and that helped buy off the predators 
who did spot him now and then. Say, 
fellow being, which would you rather 
do? Stomp me into green mush, or get 
a new battery for your music player?
 Among criminals, as among most 
people, greed was pretty dependable.
 Ratua arrived shortly at the cleared 
spot where the self-defense players 
gathered. There were eighteen or 
twenty of them, plus about that many 
prisoners and guards watching. He 
circulated, hoping to find somebody 
with a couple of spare sunfruits he 
could score for breakfast.
 Sergeant Stihl was talking about 
what to do if somebody attacked you 
with a knife as Ratua worked his way 
around the gathering.
 "Anybody know the first thing you 
do if somebody comes at you with a 
blade?" Stihl asked.
 "Run like a fleetabeesta," somebody 
said.
 To the general laughter, Stihl 
replied, "You took this class before?" 
More laughter. "Monn has it exactly 
right," the sergeant continued. "You 
make tracks away, fast as you can. 
Bare-limbed against a knife, you get 
cut, no ifs, no buts. And unless you 
scum of the galaxy have been 
industrious since last time I looked, 
you don't have much of a med-center 
anywhere around these parts. You 
could get cut bad, bleed out, or get 
infected and leave the party by the 
slow and painful exit, hey?"
 There was a murmur of agreement. 
Everybody knew that. Lose a body 
part here, it was gone for good if you 
weren't a natural regenerator. The 
state of local medicine was 
rudimentary: a few docs and other 
healers, but not a lot of equipment or 
meds. Of course, the closest bacta 
tank was a mere three hundred or so 
klicks away; unfortunately, the 
direction was vertical rather than 
horizontal, and most of the prisoners 
had few illusions about their chances 
of being hoisted up to the orbiting 
facility if they were in harm's way.
 "But if you don't have a weapon and 
you can't run, then you need another 
option. And it has to be one that 
doesn't depend on great skill because 
it won't work unless you have that, 
and even then, maybe not." Sergeant 
Stihl looked around. "Hey, Ratua, 
lemme borrow you for a minute."
 Ratua smiled. He'd done this before.
 "Lot of self-defense teachers, they 
say you have to trap and control the 
knife arm," Stihl continued. "That, not 
to put too fine a point on it, is pure 
mopak. If you aren't faster than the 
guy with the knife, that gets you 
gutted, no matter how much you 
know."
 Ratua strolled into the ragged circle 
made by the watchers. Stihl tossed 
him the practice knife, a forearm-
length dagger made out of soft-flex. 
Stiff enough to work like a real knife, 
but with enough give that if you hit 
somebody with it, it would bend 
without doing damage. The point and 
edges were coated with a harmless red 
dye that left a temporary mark on 
whatever they touched.
 "I'm twelve years deep in teras kasi," 
Stihl said. "I was the First Naval 
Fleet's Unarmed Middleweight 
Champion two years, runner-up for 
two more. Bare hand-to-hand, I 
expect I can take anybody my size on 
this planet apart, doesn't matter which 
species. Blade-to-blade, I can duel to 
a draw. Bare against a knife? I'll get 
cut. Show 'em, Ratua."
 Ratua smiled and stepped in as if he 
was in no hurry. He made a lazy 
thrust with the knife. Stihl went into a 
crouching move to grab his arm, 
only?
 Ratua did his trick.
 As the sergeant reached for his wrist, 
Ratua pulled his hand back, and while 
it looked like no big deal to him, he 
knew the watchers would see his hand 
blur.
 It wasn't a Zelosian thing, it was 
Ratua's own. He didn't know where it 
had come from, but once he kicked in 
the booster rocket he was, for a short 
time, faster than most ordinary beings. 
Way faster. Some medic who'd 
examined him once and tried to clock 
his reflex time had said something 
about mutation, about abnormally fast 
nastic response in the cellulose fiber 
that made up a large part of his 
muscle mass. Whatever the cause, it 
had come in handy more than once 
during his exile on Despayre.
 As the sergeant continued to move in 
what seemed like slow motion to 
Ratua, the latter whipped up the knife 
and made three quick slashes and a 
stab. Then he took a step back.
 Time resumed normal speed. Several 
people who had never seen the 
demonstration gasped or swore.
 Sergeant Stihl had two thin red lines 
across his neck, one on each side, 
another across his throat, and a little 
red dot under his rib cage just below 
his heart.
 After the sounds of amazement had 
died down, Stihl said, "You see?" He 
turned to Ratua. "How much fight 
training you have, Ratua?"
 "Counting today?" He grinned. "Uh, 
that would be . . .  none."
 Stihl pointed at the slashes and stab 
marks. "Any of these would have 
been enough to kill me. Green-Eyes 
here has no training. I'm an expert, but 
if that knife had been real, I'd be 
fertilizing the plants?if somebody 
bothered to bury me. Yeah, he's fast, 
freaky fast, but that's the point: you 
never know who or what you're going 
to be up against, especially here on 
Despayre. Makes you stop and think, 
doesn't it? Thanks, Ratua."
 Ratua nodded and moved out of the 
circle. These occasional little 
demonstrations were another reason 
he managed to stay alive. Predators 
preferred helpless victims, and while 
Ratua wasn't a fighter?the sight of 
blood, even if it wasn't green, made 
him ill?there were a lot slower folks 
to prey upon. Why risk your neck if 
you didn't have to?
 Stihl would go on to talk about 
position and preemptive strikes and 
such, but Ratua had heard it all 
before. He was more interested in 
finding a sunfruit, and after his 
moment in the spotlight, that would 
probably be easier. Everybody loved a 
star.
 
 Most days, Sergeant Nova Stihl felt 
as if he was part of the solution and 
not part of the problem. Being a guard 
on a prison planet was, at best, not a 
particularly glamorous duty. In fact, 
even at its best, you could carbon-
freeze it and it would still stink to 
high orbit. He'd much rather be out in 
the thick of things, fighting Rebels on 
a real field of battle, using his hard-
earned skills where they'd matter the 
most. But somebody had to be here, 
and he was philosophical enough to 
shrug off the fact that he'd been one of 
those so assigned. He'd learned a long 
time ago to make the best of the 
situation. That was all you could do if 
you were a trooper in the Imperial 
Army.
 He remembered a quote from the 
Mrlssi philosopher Jhaveek: "I know 
myself to be only as I appear to 
myself." It was a deceptively complex 
concept, couched in simple words. 
Nova smiled slightly as he thought of 
the probable reaction his fellow 
soldiers would have if they knew that 
the holos hidden beneath his bunk 
were not racy images of Twi'lek 
dancing girls, but rather dissertations 
on various schools of metaphysical 
thought detailed by the galaxy's finest 
philosophers. Not that he had 
anything against Twi'lek dancing 
girls. But his studies, over the last few 
years of his post here, had kept him 
sane?of that he was convinced.
 Most of the prisoners were indeed 
the dregs of the galaxy?bad beings 
who had broken major laws and who 
deserved to be put away for life, if not 
jettisoned from the back of a Star 
Destroyer along with the rest of the 
garbage. A few had been collected 
and shipped here by bad luck or 
accident, though he knew that most of 
those weren't exactly pillars of 
society, either. Ratua was a good 
example of this, although Nova owed 
him big-time for getting him the holos 
with only an eyebrow raised in 
reaction. But the vegetable man was 
an exception. If you checked the data 
on the majority, you'd probably find 
that most of them had gotten away 
with some full-out evil hurt aimed at 
the rest of whatever world they came 
from, so you didn't feel too bad about 
them being here. There weren't too 
many of the truly innocent who 
wound up on Despayre, though he 
knew of a few; political prisoners, 
most of them.
 Backed the wrong candidate, spoke 
up at the wrong time, didn't toe the 
party line. Nova felt some sympathy 
for those, though given how the 
galaxy was these days, probably more 
sympathy than they deserved. If 
you're dumb enough to stand in front 
of a riot trooper and make an obscene 
gesture at him, you ought not to be 
surprised if he shoots you. Troopers 
were people, they had feelings, and on 
a bad day dancing in front of one and 
calling him names could be a very bad 
idea.
 It was the same thing with politics. 
Anybody with more than vestigial 
sensory organs could tell which way 
the Imperial wind was blowing, and 
there was a war on, even though it 
hadn't been officially named as such. 
Free speech sometimes had to be 
tempered for the good of society, and 
what would have been a spirited 
discussion back when the Republic 
was in full flower was often now 
considered treason. That bothered him 
some. Maybe not as much as it 
should've, but some.
 Nova sighed. Despite his fascination 
with the conundrums posed by some 
of the galaxy's foremost scholars, he 
didn't consider himself a particularly 
deep thinker?he just did what he was 
told, which mostly consisted of 
keeping prisoners in line and trying to 
avoid situations in which he had to 
shoot them. Teaching self-defense 
classes he did on his own time; it 
helped some of the weaker inmates, 
maybe gave them a chance against the 
real predators here. At any rate, it 
made him feel better about himself. 
He liked a level playing field, and 
while his "classes" weren't going to 
accomplish that, they did smooth out 
a bump in the terrain here and there. 
Now and again he'd hear a story about 
how someone from his classes used 
what he taught to avoid being maimed 
or killed, and that made him feel 
good. He was pretty careful screening 
his would-be prisoner students. Yes, 
they were all crooked as sand snakes, 
but he tried to keep out the ones who 
were aggressive?the ones who'd take 
what he taught them and use it for 
something other than self-defense. He 
had a lot of smaller beings as 
students, weaker ones, and those 
convicted of crimes that were about 
money rather than violence. He 
absolutely did not want to make a 
stone killer better at killing. More 
than enough of that went on in the 
galaxy already, much of it right here 
on Despayre.
 His comlink chirped on his belt, 
signaling the morning recall. Time to 
wrap up the class and get back to the 
guard station, check in, get his next 
assignment. Some of the other guards 
thought he was foolish for mingling 
with the prisoners?you didn't get to 
carry a blaster or even a shock baton 
unless you went out in a quad or a 
platoon-sized group, for fear that the 
prisoners would attack you and take 
your weapon. But Nova wasn't 
concerned about that. The really bad 
actors here knew enough not to mess 
with him bare-handed, and if they 
pulled a beam or projectile weapon 
and took him out, they knew the 
chances were excellent they'd be dead 
before the next sunrise. Guard troops 
took care of their own, and if you 
attacked one, you attacked them all. 
They were protective of one another, 
but there were limits observed for the 
greater good. If you took a guard 
hostage and tried to use him or her or 
it for leverage, it got you and the 
guard and anybody within a hundred 
meters turned into a smoking crater. 
No negotiation, no compromise, just a 
big, sleek thermal bomb arcing out of 
the compound and onto your position. 
You couldn't hide, because the bomb 
zeroed in on the guard's implant, 
which couldn't be turned off or 
destroyed unless you knew exactly 
where it was, and that location was 
different for every guard on the 
planet. You'd have to completely skin 
the guard alive before finding it, and, 
while that wasn't a deal breaker for a 
lot of the planetary inmates?more, in 
fact, like a bonus for some of them?
the catch was that even if you killed 
the guard, the implant kept working 
and reported its wearer dead. Which 
meant the bomb was on its way, and 
not even a fleetabeesta with its tails 
on fire could get out of range in time.
 This was a big planet, but not so big 
that they couldn't find you. Knowing 
this tended to keep a lot of the more 
violent prisoners in line. Because of 
all this, not to mention his own 
considerable skills, Sergeant Nova 
Stihl wasn't worried about going 
among the scum. Tough beings 
recognized each other, and nobody 
looked at him and saw an easy target.
 And besides all that, he had Blink.
 The comlink chirped again. "Stihl?" 
came the lieutenant's voice from it.
 "Yes, sir."
 "You going to play pattycake with
